The amount of remaining \\n OH on the silica surface after this treatment ranges from 0.1 to 2 mmoles OH per g of silica, preferably between 0.5 and \\n 1.5 mmoles OH per g of silica. The impregnation is preferably carried out by Suspending \\n 10 to 20 parts by weight of silica for each 100 parts by volume of a solution of an organometallic compound of the groups 1, \\n 2, 12 or 13, in aliphatic hydrocarbons, and maintaining the \\n Solution with stirring at a temperature which ranges from \\n room temperature to the boiling point of the solution of the organometallic compound of the groups 1, 2, 12 or 13, in aliphatic hydrocarbons, preferably at room temperature, over \\n a period from 30 to 120 minutes, preferably between 50 and \\n 60 minutes. \\n The organometallic compounds of groups 1, 2, 12 or 13 of \\n the periodic table suitable for use in step (a) are alkyl com pounds and alkyl halide compounds of metals belonging to \\n these groups, and preferably aluminum, magnesium, lithium and Zinc compounds. Specific examples of these compounds \\n are trimethylaluminum, triethylaluminum (TEAL), methyla \\n luminum dichloride, methylaluminum sesquichloride, isobu tylaluminum dichloride, isobutylaluminum sesquichloride, \\n ethylaluminum dichloride (EADC), diethylaluminum chlo \\n ride (DEAC), ethylaluminum sesquichloride (EASC), tri-n- \\n hexylaluminum (Tn-HAL), tri-n-octylaluminum (TnOAL). butyl ethylmagnesium (BEM), butyl octylmagnesium \\n (BOMAG), methylmagnesium chloride and ethylmagnesium \\n chloride. They can be used concentrated or preferably dis \\n Solved in the above organic solvent or in a different organic Solvent chosen from aliphatic hydrocarbons. \\n Specific aliphatic hydrocarbons used as solvents for the \\n above mentioned solution can have between 4 and 50 car \\n bons, preferably between 6 and 20 carbons. Specific examples of these aliphatic hydrocarbons used as solvents are \\n hexane, heptane, octane, isoparaffin, and the more preferably \\n hexane and heptane. In step (a) of the process, the impregnation step using the \\n Solution of organometallic compound of the groups 1, 2, 12 or \\n 13, in aliphatic hydrocarbons, is carried out by using an amount of organometallic compound, ranging from 0.1 to 1 \\n mmole of the organometallic solution per mmole of OH on \\n the silica surface, preferably 0.3 to 0.7 mmoles of the orga \\n nometallic solution per mmole of OH on the silica surface. At the end of the impregnation treatment, the silica can be removed (step b) from the Suspension by usual methods such as settling and siphoning, filtration or centrifugation. The \\n operating temperature of this step can vary from room tem perature to the boiling point of the aliphatic hydrocarbonused \\n as the solvent, preferably at room temperature. The wet silica \\n is directly used in the next step. \\n According to the present invention, in step (c) of the pro \\n cess, a liquid component from the reaction between at least one magnesium compound, chosen from magnesium halides \\n and magnesium alkoxides and at least one titanium com \\n pound, chosen from titanium alkoxides and titanium halogen alkoxides, is prepared. Generally, it is necessary to heat the \\n mixture of these compounds, at a temperature in the range of \\n about 100° C. to about 200° C., preferably between 140° C. \\n and 160° C., over a period of time from 1 to 100 hours, preferably between 10 and 30 hours. The mixture comprising said compounds has to be prepared under turbulent stirring \\n and underinert conditions. After the formation of the product obtained from the reaction between these compounds, which is noted by the disappearance of the Solid Suspension, the \\n temperature of the obtained liquid product can be reduced to ambient temperature without precipitation of any solid. This \\n liquid component is diluted in an inert organic solvent to form 10 \\n 15 \\n 25 \\n 30 \\n 35 \\n 40 \\n 45 \\n 50 \\n 55 \\n 60 \\n 65 6 \\n a clear Solution. Specific organic Solvents used for the above mentioned solution can be aliphatic hydrocarbons having \\n between 4 and 50 carbons, preferably between 6 and 20 carbons. Specific examples of these aliphatic hydrocarbons \\n used as organic solvents are: hexane, heptane, octane, isopar \\n affin, most preferably hexane and heptane. \\n The magnesium compounds Suitable for the purpose of the \\n invention are those having the formulae MgX or Mg (OR), \\n wherein R represents a linear or branched alkyl group, con \\n taining from 1 to 10 carbons and X represents a halogenatom \\n and preferably a chlorine atom.

Specific examples of these com pounds are: titanium tetra-n-propylate, titanium tetra-n-buty \\n late, titanium tetra-1-propylate, titanium tetra-1-butylate and \\n the corresponding titanium mono- or di-chloroalkoxides. \\n The amount of titanium compound used in the above preparation corresponds to an amount ranging from 0.01 to 1 \\n g of titanium per g of silica, preferably between 0.0175 and \\n 0.175 g of titanium per g of silica. In general, when preparing the solution of the step (c), \\n titanium is used in Such an amount that the molar ratio Ti/Mg varies within the range of 0.3 to 4, and preferably within the range of 0.5 to 2. \\n In step (d) the silica obtained in step (b) is suspended in an inert organic solvent, such as a hydrocarbon Solvent of the aliphatic type, preferably the same used in the previous steps \\n and the dissolved product prepared in step (c) is added to the Suspension. The impregnation is carried out by Suspending \\n 100 parts by weight of silica, obtained on step (b), for each 5 to 200 parts by volume of the component prepared on step (c) \\n and after dilution in the inert organic solvent. The Suspension is maintained under stirring at a temperature that ranges from \\n room temperature to the boiling point of the mixture, prefer \\n ably at 60°C., over a period of time from 30 to 180 minutes, preferably between 50 and 60 minutes. In this way a solid component Suspended in an inert organic solvent is obtained. \\n Optionally the solid component obtained in step (d) can be \\n Submitted to reducing conditions in a step (e). Said result is obtained, for example, by using reducing agents, such as Na-alkyls, Li-alkyls, Zn-alkyls, Mg-alkyls and correspond \\n ing aryl-derivatives, Grignard compounds of the type RMgX. \\n wherein R represents a linear or branched alkyl group, con taining from 1 to 10 carbons or aryl-derivatives and X repre sents a halogenatom and preferably a chlorine atom, Al-alkyl \\n halide compounds or by using reducing agents such as silicon compounds.

This \\n addition is carried out slowly over a period of time from 30 to \\n 180 minutes, preferably between 50 and 80 minutes and the Solid Suspension is maintained under stirring at a temperature \\n ranging from room temperature to the boiling point of the \\n aliphatic hydrocarbon used as solvent, preferably at 60° C. \\n The amount of reducing agent that can be used in step (e) \\n corresponds to the amount ranging from 0 to 2 moles per mole \\n of titanium, preferably between 0 and 0.1 mole per mole of \\n titanium. It has been observed, in the experiments, that the \\n quantity used of this reducing agent can control the amount of \\n titanium fixed on silica at the final catalyst. In the next step of the process according to the present \\n invention, the Suspension obtained in (d) or (e), which is still under stirring, is put in contact and interacted with one or more halogenating agents. \\n Halogenating agents useful in the practice of the present \\n invention can be either liquid or gaseous materials, pure or preferably dissolved in an inert organic solvent. Representa \\n tive but non-exhaustive examples of halogenating agents use \\n ful in the present invention are methylaluminum dichloride, methylaluminum sesquichloride, isobutylaluminum dichlo \\n ride, isobutylaluminum sesquichloride, ethylaluminum \\n dichloride (EADC), diethylaluminum chloride (DEAC), ethylaluminum sesquichloride (EASC), SiCl, SnCl4, HCl, \\n Cl, HSiCl, aluminum chloride, ethylboron dichloride, boron chloride, diethylboron chloride, HCC1, PC1, POCl, acetyl chlorides, thionyl chloride, sulfur chloride, methyl \\n trichlorosilane, dimethyl dichlorosilane, TiCl, VC1, CC1, t-butyl chloride, n-butyl chloride, chloroform, 1,1,1-trichlo \\n roethane, 1.1.2-trichloroethane, 1,2-dichloroethane and \\n dichloromethane. \\n The preferred halogenating agents are chlorinating agents \\n and of these SiCl, SnCl4, HCl, Cl, HSiCl, methyl trichlo rosilane, dimethyl dichlorosilane, t-butyl chloride, n-butyl \\n chloride, chloroform, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, 1,1,2-trichloro \\n ethane, 1,2-dichloroethane and dichloromethane are pre ferred, most preferably SiCl The amount of halogenating agent used in the step (f) of the process corresponds to the amount ranging from 0.5 to 3 moles of halogenating agent per mole of titanium, preferably \\n between 1 and 1.8 moles of halogenating agent per mole of \\n titanium. \\n The time necessary for halogenating Ti-alkoxide and optionally Mg-alkoxide varies from 0.5 hour to 5 hours, pref \\n erably from 1.5 hours to 2.5 hours. The temperature of the Solid Suspension halogenation ranges from room temperature \\n to the boiling point of the aliphatic hydrocarbon used as \\n solvent, preferably at 60° C. According to the present invention, in step (g) of the pro \\n cess, the Solid obtained in (f) is kept under higher temperature \\n that depends on the inert organic solvent used. \\n The time necessary for this thermal treatment of the solid obtained in step (f) ranges from 0.5 hour to 5 hours, preferably from 3 to 5 hours. The ideal temperature for this purpose \\n depends on the organic solvent used and it can be conducted 5 \\n 10 \\n 15 \\n 25 \\n 30 \\n 35 \\n 40 \\n 45 \\n 50 \\n 55 \\n 60 \\n 65 8 \\n from 60° C. to 120° C., preferably from 60°C. to 75°C., when hexane is used as the organic solvent. \\n At the step (h) after the thermal treatment, the solid can be separated from the Suspension, for example by settling and \\n siphoning, filtration or centrifugation, washed with an inert \\n organic solvent, preferably hexane, and then dried. The wash ing temperature can vary from room temperature to the boil \\n ing point of the aliphatic hydrocarbon used as solvent, pref erably at room temperature. \\n Optionally, the solid obtained in (h) is washed with a solu tion of organometallic compounds of the groups 1, 2, 12 or 13. \\n More specifically, in the optional step (i) the solid obtained in \\n step (h) is suspended in an inert organic solvent such as \\n hexane or heptane, and it is put in contact with one or more organometallic compounds of the groups 1, 2, 12 or 13 of the periodic table, preferably metal-alkyl compounds or metal \\n alkylhalide compounds belonging to these groups, in special \\n aluminum, magnesium, lithium and Zinc compounds. Spe cific examples of these compounds are methylaluminum \\n dichloride, methylaluminum sesquichloride, isobutylalumi \\n num dichloride, isobutylaluminum sesquichloride, ethylalu \\n minum dichloride (EADC), diethylaluminum chloride (DEAC), ethylaluminum sesquichloride (EASC), tri-n-hexy \\n laluminum (Tn-HAL), tri-n-octylaluminum (TnOAL). They \\n can be used concentrated or preferably dissolved in the above organic solvent or in a different organic solvent chosen from aliphatic hydrocarbons. The process is carried out at a tem perature ranging from room temperature to the boiling point \\n of the organic solvent used as solvent, preferably at room temperature, for a period of time that can vary from 10 min \\n utes to 24 hours, preferably from 40 minutes to 5 hours. When using more than one organometallic compound in \\n the step (i), the different compounds can be fed in the same \\n Solution or in individual Solutions, at the same time or in Subsequent additions. \\n The amount of the metal-alkyl halide compound of the groups 1, 2, 12 or 13 or metal-alkyl compound of the groups \\n 1, 2, 12 or 13, used in the step (i) of the process corresponds \\n to the amount ranging from 0 to 3 g of the corresponding metal-alkyl halide compound of the groups 1, 2, 12 or 13 or \\n metal-alkyl compound of the groups 1, 2, 12 or 13, per g of \\n dry catalyst component obtained, preferably between 0.05 and 1 g of the corresponding metal-alkylhalide compound of \\n the groups 1, 2, 12 or 13 or metal-alkyl compound of the groups 1, 2, 12 or 13, per g of dry catalyst component \\n obtained. \\n The use of inert organic solvents, most specifically ali phatic hydrocarbons, in all process steps of the present inven \\n tion brings another important feature to the Solid catalyst \\n component characteristics. The Solid catalyst component \\n obtained is completely free of residual polar solvents, such as \\n ethanol, and their derivatives in its final composition. \\n The titanium amount that remains fixed on the Solid cata \\n lyst component may reach up to 10% by weight, expressed as \\n the Timetal content, and it is preferably comprised between 0.5 and 2% by weight. \\n The magnesium amount that remains fixed on the Solid catalyst component may reach up to 6% by weight, expressed \\n as the Mg metal content, and it is preferably comprised \\n between 0.3 and 3.0% by weight. \\n The chlorine amount that remains fixed on the solid cata \\n lyst component may reach up to 20% by weight, expressed as \\n the C1 contents, and it is preferably between 5 and 12% by weight. \\n The alkoxy amount that remains fixed on the Solid catalyst component may reach up to 20% by weight and it is prefer \\n ably between 3 and 8% by weight.  US 9,352,308 B2 \\n The amount of organometallic compound of the groups 1, \\n 2, 12 or 13 that remains fixed on the solid catalyst component may reach up to 5% by weight, expressed as the metal con \\n tents, and it is preferably between 0.3 and 3% by weight. This organometallic compound of the groups 1, 2, 12 or 13 are metal-alkyl compounds or metal-alkyl halide compounds belonging to these groups, in special organoaluminum, orga \\n nomagnesium, organolithium and organozinc compounds, \\n pure or in mixtures. The particle size distribution of the solid catalyst compo \\n nent of the present invention is very close to the silica used as carrier and, as consequence, its average particle size ranges \\n also from 10 to 120 um. The solid catalyst component surface area ranges from 80 to 300 m/g and its pore volume ranges \\n from 0.1 to 1.0 ml/g. The catalyst component of the present invention is Suitable for using in liquid phase or gas phase, ethylene polymeriza \\n tion process. The co-catalyst used in the polymerization pro \\n cess is an alkyl-aluminum, preferably trimethyl aluminum or \\n triethyl aluminum. The mass ratio co-catalyst:catalyst in the polymerization process is between 0.5:1 and 6.0:1. \\n An important feature is its ability to produce, when sub \\n mitted to polymerization conditions, particles of homo and copolymers of ethylene with controlled morphology having \\n high bulk density and containing a very Small quantity of \\n fines. This feature allows the use of this catalyst in a process where the catalyst can be fed directly into the polymerization \\n reactor. Particular forms to feed the catalyst are in dry bulk powder, in paste, in oil Suspension or in solvent Suspension. \\n As an alternative the catalyst can be prepolymerized with \\n ethylene or propylene and optionally with a comonomer \\n before being fed into the reactor. Another important feature of the present invention is its tolerance to the high electrostatic charges occurring in gas \\n phase reactors. This feature helps to prevent the formation of \\n polymer sheets or agglomerates on the reactor walls. The \\n good catalytic yield and the low decay kinetics observed for \\n the present invention, allows its use in most polymerization processes, including processes operating in more than one \\n reactor in series. \\n A further feature characteristic of the catalyst of the present invention is when using a microspheroidal silica as Support \\n the catalyst obtained has also a spheroidal morphology and in consequence a polymer product with good morphology and \\n flowability is obtained. \\n The catalyst component of the present invention is advan tageously used in the polymerization of ethylene and mix \\n tures thereof with alpha-olefins CH2=CHR, wherein R is an alkyl or cicloalkyl or aryl radical with 1-12 carbon atoms \\n because it has a high activity and low decay kinetics. In particular, it is used in the preparation of: High density polyethylenes (HDPE, having a density greater than 0.940 g/cm), particularly with narrow \\n molecular weight distribution (MFR-27), including homopolymers of ethylene and copolymers of ethylene \\n with one or more alpha-olefins having from 3 to 14 \\n carbon atoms. These products are particularly Suitable for thermoforming and injection applications; \\n Linear medium density and linear low density polyethyl \\n enes (LMDPE and LLDPE, having a density lower than 0.940 g/cm) most specifically very low and ultra low \\n density linear polyethylenes (VLDPE and ULDPE, hav ing a density lower than 0.920 g/cm and as low as 0.880 g/m) consisting of copolymers of ethylene with one or \\n more alpha-olefins having from 3 to 14 carbon atoms, having a content of units derived from ethylene greater than approximately 80% by weight. These products 10 \\n 15 \\n 25 \\n 30 \\n 35 \\n 40 \\n 45 \\n 50 \\n 55 \\n 60 \\n 65 10 \\n have an improved structure due to the very good \\n comonomer insertion and, in most cases, they have also \\n a narrow molecular weight distribution (MFR-27). \\n Hence the low xylene soluble contents are obtained, allowing the production of films with superior optical \\n properties and very low blocking. The LMDPE products are particularly useful for rotomolding applications; \\n Elastomeric copolymers of ethylene and propylene and \\n elastomeric terpolymers of ethylene and propylene with \\n minor amounts of a diene, having a content of units derived from ethylene comprised between about 30 and 70% by weight. \\n EXAMPLES \\n The present invention is now explained in more details by \\n means of the following Examples, which should not be under \\n stood as limiting the scope of the invention.

The solid thus obtained was again suspended in 2200 ml of anhydrous hexane and then 60 g of DEAC (0.498 moles) in 200 ml of anhydrous hexane were added to the resulting Suspension under gently stirring. Contact was maintained for 50 min at room temperature. Finally, the Supernatant liquid was removed and the solid was dried at 60°C. under nitrogen flow thus giving 300 g of a brown-reddish powder. The chemical and physical characteristics of the resulting reddish powder were as follows: Total Titanium=2.0% (by weight) Mg1.3% (by weight) SiO=76.3% (by weight) Al=2.3% (by weight) Cl=10.8% (by weight) OBu=6.3% (by weight) Surface Area (B.E.T.)=200 m/g Pore Volume (B.E.T.)=0.45 cm/g', type='catalyst_synthesis', reference=[]), ExperimentInfo(id='Example 11', text_of_example='Polymerization of Ethylene (HDPE) A 4-liter stainless steel autoclave, purged under nitrogen flow for 1 hour at 75° C. and then cooled to 30° C., was fed with 0.06 g of the solid catalyst component from the example 8,0.79g of TEAL mixed with 75 ml of anhydrous hexane, and 280 g of anhydrous propane.
