<h2>SOLID  CATALYST  COMPONENT FOR POLYMERIZATION  AND  COPOLYMERIZATION OF  ETHYLENE,  AND,  PROCESS  FOR  OBTAINING THE  SAME</h2>
<p>0001. The present invention  relates  to a solid catalyst component for ethylene polymerization and  copolymeriza tion,  composed of a  carrier  of particulate  silica  and a catalytically active portion including titanium, magnesium, chlorine, alkoxy groups and at least  one organometallic compound  of  the  groups 1, 2, 12  or  13  of he  periodic table. t The  process for obtaining  the catalyst of  the  present  inven tion comprises the steps of</p>
<p>0002 (a) impregnating  an activated silica In particles using  a  solution of  an  organometallic  compound  of  the groups 1, 2, 12 or 13 of  the  periodic table, in an  inert organic solvent;</p>
<p>0003) (b)  removing  the  supernatant  liquid  from  the  step (a):</p>
<p>0004 (c) preparing a solution obtained  by reacting at least one magnesium compound, selected from mag nesium halides and magnesium alkoxides and  at least one  titanium compound  selected from titanium alkox ides and  titanium halogen alkoxides;</p>
<p>0005 (d) impregnating  the  silica obtained  on  (b)  using the solution prepared in (c);</p>
<p>0006 (e) optionally reacting the solid obtained In (d) with a reducing agent;</p>
<p>0007 (f) reacting the solid obtained  in (d) or  (e) with a halogenating agent;</p>
<p>0008 (g) treating thermally the solid obtained in (f);</p>
<p>0009 (h) washing the solid obtained in (g) with an inert organic solvent;</p>
<p>0010 (i) optionally, washing the solid  obtained in (h) with a solution of  one or more  organometallic com pounds  of  the  groups  1, 2, 12  or  13  of he  periodic  table. t</p>
<p>0011. The  catalyst  component  obtained  is especially suit able  for  the  production  of  homo- nd  copolymers  of  ethylene a as narrow molecular  weight distribution high density poly ethylene  and  linear  low  density  polyethylene  with  controlled morphology and  improved  properties.</p>
<h2>BACKGROUND  OF  THE  INVENTION</h2>
<p>1) Polymerization Process</p>
<p>0012. The  slurry or  gas  phase  processes for the produc tion of  HDPE  or LLDPE  operating with low bulk density polymer  need  reactors with large Volumes  in order  to  obtain the necessary residence time. Particularly, in the gas phase reactors the presence  of  fines with low  bulk  density causes troubles. In fact, due  to the  friction of  the  polymer  particles present  into the  reactor  the  fines are  especially prone  to the formation of  electrostatic charges and tend to deposit and adhere to the metallic walls. These stagnant deposits does not  allow the  exchange  of  the  reaction  heat  and  become  hot spots,  which can form layer of agglomerates containing eventually  melt  polymer.  After  some  time  chunks  of agglomerates can fall down  and  plug  the  product discharge system. The  described  effects are enhanced when  the reac tion is carried out with a  highly active catalyst.</p>
<p>0013. In  the  U.S.  Pat.  No.  5,410,002  a summary of patents on the above described phenomena  is presented.</p>
<p>0014. Therefore, it  is  crucial for the process that the catalyst used enables a total control of  the polymer mor phology  resulting in  product  grains without  fines, with  high bulk  density and  good  flowing  properties.</p>
<p>0015. Another very important aspect is that the catalyst must  have  a  slow  decaying  time  to  permit  the  use  of  reactors in series. This arrangement makes  possible the obtainment of  bimodal products in addition the reduction of  the total volume  of  reaction  for  the  same  production  basis. Moreover, process operation with  a  different  condition of  reaction in  at least  two  reactors  in  series,  turns  possible  the  use  of atalysts c with higher  particle size thereby minimizing  the formation of  electrostatic charges.</p>
<h2>2) Polymer  Structure</h2>
<p>0016. The catalyst  properties  are  fundamental  to  the polymer  structure,  mainly  in respect  of  the  molecular  weight distribution, comonomer insertion in the polymeric chain and  soluble content.</p>
<p>0017. Each application used to achieve a final product from high density polyethylene (HDPE)  or linear low den sity  polyethylene (LLDPE) requires a specific polymeric Structure.</p>
<p>0018 To  obtain  a  film  with  improved  optical  and mechanical  properties and  avoid  blocking  problems,  a  poly mer  having narrow molecular weight distribution (MFR-27), is required. A  large quantity of  LLDPE  appli cations requires products with density=0.918 and MI=0.7. and  in most  cases  a  xylene  soluble  content&lt;10%  is desired. Indeed, when  the xylene soluble content of  the polymer  is present in a high concentration (&gt;10%) and with a low molecular weight, this soluble tends to migrate to the film Surface causing blocking, in addition to the unsatisfactory optical properties (low gloss and  high haze).</p>
<h2>3) Ziegler-Natta polyethylene  catalyst</h2>
<p>0019. Due  to the  strong  competition  existent  in the  poly ethylene market,  the  catalyst  production  cost  is a  fundamen tal  component.  Therefore  it is mandatory  that  the  catalyst  for producing  polyethylene  be  manufactured  by  a  simple  route, from low cost raw material, without generating gaseous, liquid or  solid effluents hard  to treat.</p>
<p>0020. The patent U.S. Pat. No. 5,188,997 describes a synthesis  process  for  Ziegler-Natta  catalysts from  silica and magnesium chloride alcoholate. The  results reported dem onstrate that  this catalyst  produces  a  polymer  with  low  bulk density  (0.23 to 0.30  g/ml)  and  with  an  intermediate  molecu lar weight distribution (MFR  30.0 to 37.8).</p>
<p>0021. The  patent U.S. Pat. No. 5,585.317 describes the synthesis of  a catalyst Supported on a magnesium chloride based carrier. The  reported examples relates to the produc tion of  polymers  having  good  morphology,  characterized  by the  absence  of  fines  and  by  the  high  bulk  density  which  is for LLDPE  produced  between  0.32  and  0.40  g/ml  and  for  HDPE between 0.33 and 0.438  g/ml.</p>
<p>0022. However, in the case of LLDPE  production, the polymer  obtained presents an undesired comonomer  distri bution in its chain, evidenced by the high xylene soluble content at different polymer densities. As an example, a</p>
<p>polyethylene with 0.919 g/ml of polymer density has a xylene soluble content  of  12.5%  by  weight.</p>
<h2>SUMMARY  OF  THE  INVENTION</h2>
<p>0023 The present invention  relates  to a solid catalyst component for ethylene polymerization and  copolymeriza tion,  composed of a  carrier  of particulate  silica  and a catalytically active portion Including titanium, magnesium, chlorine, alkoxy groups and at least  one organometallic compound  of  the  groups 1, 2, 12  or  13  of he  periodic table. t The  process for  obtaining the catalyst of  the  present Inven tion comprises the steps of</p>
<p>0024 (a) impregnating  an activated silica in particles using  a  solution of  an  organometallic  compound  of  the groups 1, 2, 12 or 13 of  the  periodic table, in an  inert organic solvent;</p>
<p>0025 (b)  removing  the  supernatant  liquid  from  the  step (a):</p>
<p>0026 (c) preparing a solution obtained  by reacting at least one magnesium compound, selected from mag nesium halides and magnesium alkoxides and  at least one  titanium compound  selected from titanium alkox ides and  titanium halogen alkoxides;</p>
<p>0027 (d) impregnating  the  silica obtained  on  (b)  using the solution prepared in (c);</p>
<p>0028 (e) optionally reacting the solid obtained in (d) with a reducing agent;</p>
<p>0029 (f) reacting the solid obtained  in (d) or  (e) with a halogenating agent;</p>
<p>0030 (g) treating thermally the solid obtained in (f);</p>
<p>0031 (h) washing the solid obtained in (g) with an inert organic solvent;</p>
<p>0032 (I) optionally, washing  the solid  obtained in (h) with a solution  of one or more metal-alkyl  halide compounds  of  the  groups 1, 2, 12  or 13 of  the  periodic table.</p>
<p>0033. Therefore,  the  present  Invention  provides  a  catalyst especially suitable  for  the  production  of thylene  homo-  and e copolymers as narrow molecular weight distribution high density polyethylene (NMWHDPE)  and linear low density polyethylene  (LLDPE) with controlled  morphology and improved  properties.</p>
<p>0034 Additionally, the  catalyst described  and  claimed  in the present invention produces a NMWHDPE  with a melt flow ratio (MFR)  lower  than 27  that  are  particularly suitable for thermoforming  and  injection applications.</p>
<p>0035) Further, the catalyst described and  claimed in the present invention produces a LLDPE with a low xylene soluble content due  to the very good  comonomer  insertion allowing  the  production  of  films with  Superior  optical prop erties and  very low blocking.</p>
<p>0036) The  present invention provides still a  catalyst that provides,  when Submitted to  polymerization  conditions, particles of  ethylene  homo nd  copolymers  having  high  bulk a density and  containing a very Small quantity of  fines.</p>
<p>0037. The  present  invention  provides  additionally  a  cata lyst useful in liquid phase or in gas phase, ethylene poly merization process.</p>
<p>0038. The present invention provides further a catalyst useful  in  polymerization  process  due  to its high  activity  and low decay kinetics.</p>

<p>0065. In step (d) the silica obtained on step (b) is sus pended in an inert organic solvent, Such as a hydrocarbon solvent  of he  aliphatic  type,  preferably the  same  used  in  the t previous steps  and  the  dissolved  product  prepared  on  Step  (c) is added  to the  Suspension.

The  temperature  of the Solid Suspension halogenation ranges from room tem perature to the boiling point of  the aliphatic hydrocarbon used as solvent, preferably at 60° C.</p>
<p>0075 According to the present invention, in step (g) of the process, the solid obtained in (f) is kept under  higher temperature that depends on  the inert organic solvent used.</p>
<p>0076. The  time  necessary  for  this  thermal  treatment  of he t solid obtained in step (f) ranges from 0.5 hour  to 5  hours, preferably from  3 to 5  hours. The  ideal temperature  for  this purpose depends on the organic solvent used  and  it can be conducted  from  60°  C.  to 120°  C.,  preferably  from  60°  C.  to 75° C., when  hexane  is used  as the organic solvent.</p>
<p>0077. At  the  step  (h)  after  the  thermal  treatment,  the  solid can be separated from the Suspension,  for example by settling and siphoning, filtration or centrifugation, washed with an inert organic solvent, preferably hexane, and  then dried. The  washing temperature can vary from room tem perature to the boiling point of  the aliphatic hydrocarbon used as solvent, preferably at room  temperature.</p>
<p>0078. Optionally,  the  solid  obtained  in  (h)  is washed  with a solution of  organometallic compounds  of  the  groups 1, 2, 12  or 13. More  specifically, in the  optional step (i) the solid obtained in step (h) is suspended  in an  inert organic  solvent Such  as  hexane  or  heptane,  and  it is put  in contact  with  one</p>
<p>or  more  organometallic  compounds  of  the  groups  1, 2, 12  or 13 of  the periodic table, preferably metal-alkyl compounds or  metal-alkyl  halide  compounds  belonging  to  these  groups, in  special aluminum, magnesium, lithium and Zinc com pounds.

<p>0079 When using more than one organometallic com pound  in the  step (i), the different  compounds  can  be  fed  in the  same  solution  or  in  individual  Solutions,  at  the  same  time or in Subsequent  additions.</p>
<p>0080. The  amount  of  the  metal-alkyl  halide  compound  of the groups 1, 2, 12 or 13 or metal-alkyl compound  of  the groups 1, 2, 12 or 13, used in the step (i)  of  the process corresponds to the amount ranging from 0 to 3 g of  the corresponding  metal-alkyl  halide  compound  of  the  groups  1, 2, 12 or 13 or  metal-alkyl compound  of  the groups 1, 2, 12 or 13, per  g  of  dry catalyst component  obtained, preferably between 0.05 and 1  g of the corresponding metal-alkyl halide  compound  of  the  groups 1, 2, 12  or  13  or  metal-alkyl compound  of  the  groups 1, 2, 12  or 13, per  g  of ry  catalyst d component obtained.</p>
<p>0081. The  use  of  inert  organic  solvents, most  specifically aliphatic hydrocarbons, in all process steps of  the present invention  brings  another important  feature  to  the  Solid catalyst component  characteristics. The  Solid catalyst com ponent obtained is  completely free of  residual polar sol vents,  such as ethanol, and their derivatives  in  its  final composition.</p>
<p>0082 The  titanium  amount  that  remains  fixed  on  the  solid catalyst  component  may reach  up to  10% by weight, expressed as  the Ti  metal content, and it  is  preferably comprised between 0.5 and  2%  by weight.</p>
<p>0083. The  magnesium  amount  that remains fixed on  the Solid catalyst component may reach up to 6%  by weight, expressed as the Mg  metal content, and it  is  preferably comprised between 0.3 and  3.0%  by weight.</p>
<p>0084. The  chlorine  amount  that  remains  fixed  on  the  solid catalyst  component  may reach  up to  20% by weight, expressed  as the C1  contents,  and  it is preferably between 5 and 12%  by weight.</p>
<p>0085. The  alkoxy  amount  that remains fixed on  the solid catalyst component  may  reach up  to 20%  by  weight  and  it is preferably between  3  and  8%  by weight.</p>

<p>0087. The  particle size distribution of  the solid catalyst component  of  the  present  invention  is very  close  to  the  silica used  as  carrier  and,  as  consequence,  its average  particle size ranges  also  from  10  to 120  um.  The  solid  catalyst  component surface  area  ranges  from  80  to  300  m/g nd  its  pore  volume a ranges from 0.1 to 1.0 ml/g.</p>
<p>0088. The  catalyst component  of  the  present  invention is Suitable for using in liquid phase or gas phase, ethylene polymerization process. The co-catalyst used in the poly merization process is an alkyl-aluminum, preferably trim ethyl aluminum or triethyl aluminum. The mass ratio co catalyst:  catalyst in the polymerization process is  between 0.5:1 and 6.0:1.</p>
<p>0089 An  important  feature  is its ability to  produce,  when Submitted to polymerization conditions, particles of  homo and copolymers of ethylene with controlled morphology having high bulk density  and containing  a  very  small quantity of  fines. This  feature  allows  the  use  of  this catalyst in a  process where  the catalyst can be fed directly into the polymerization reactor. Particular forms  to feed the  catalyst are in dry bulk powder, in paste, in oil suspension or in Solvent Suspension. As an alternative the catalyst can be prepolymerized with ethylene or propylene and optionally with a comonomer  before being fed into the reactor.</p>
<p>0090 Another  important feature of  the  present invention is its tolerance  to  the  high  electrostatic charges  occurring  in gas phase  reactors. This  feature helps to prevent  the  forma tion of  polymer  sheets  or  agglomerates  on  the  reactor  walls. The  good  catalytic  yield  and  the  low  decay  kinetics  observed for the present invention, allows its use in most polymer ization processes, including processes operating in  more than one  reactor in series.</p>
<p>0091. A  further  feature  characteristic  of he  catalyst  of he t t present  invention is when  using  a  microspheroidal silica as Support  the  catalyst obtained  has  also  a  spheroidal morphol ogy and in  consequence a polymer product with good morphology and flowability is obtained.</p>
<p>0092. The  catalyst component  of  the  present  invention is advantageously used in the polymerization of  ethylene and mixtures thereof  with  alpha-olefins CH=CHR,  wherein R is an alkyl or cycloalkyl or aryl radical with 1-12 carbon atoms  because  it has  a  high  activity and  low  decay  kinetics. In particular, it is used  in the  preparation of</p>
<p>0093. High density  polyethylenes (HDPE,  having  a den sity  greater than 0.940 g/cm), particularly  with narrow molecular weight distribution (MFR-27), including homopolymers  of  ethylene  and  copolymers  of  ethylene  with one  or  more  alpha-olefins  having  from  3  to 14  carbon  atoms. These  products are particularly suitable for thermoforming and  injection applications;</p>
<p>0094) Linear medium density  and linear  low  density polyethylenes  (LMDPE  and  LLDPE,  having  a  density  lower than  0.940  g/cm)  most  specifically very  low  and  ultra low density linear  polyethylenes  (VLDPE  and  ULDPE,  having  a density lower than 0.920  g/cm  and  as low  as 0.880  g/m) consisting of copolymers of ethylene with one or more</p>
<p>alpha-olefins having from 3 to 14 carbon atoms, having a content  of nits derived  from  ethylene  greater  than  approxi u mately 80% by weight. These products  have improved properties  due  to  the  very  good  comonomer  insertion  and,  in most cases,  they  have also  a  narrow  molecular weight distribution (MFR-27). Hence  the low  xylene soluble con tents are obtained, allowing the production of  films with Superior optical  properties  and very  low blocking.  The LMDPE products are particularly useful for rotomolding applications;</p>
<p>0.095 Elastomeric  copolymers  of  ethylene  and  propylene and  elastomeric  terpolymers  of  ethylene  and  propylene  with minor  amounts  of  a  diene,  having  a  content  of nits derived u from ethylene comprised between about 30 and 70% by weight.</p>

The  bed  of olymer  particles p in reaction Zone 3 is  kept in fluidized state by a recycle stream 4 that works as a fluidizing medium as well as a dissipating heat agent for absorbing the exothermal heat generated  within reaction  Zone  3. The  superficial velocity  of the gas, resulting from the flow rate of  recycle stream 4 within reactor  1 is 0.7 m/s. Stream  5,  which  contains  the  gas discharged from reactor 1, said gas having low monomer contents, is fed to the Suction of  compressor 6. The  com bined  reaction  and  compression  heats  are  then  removed  from recycle stream 5 in an external heat exchange system 7 in order  to control  the  reactor  temperature.  The  composition  of stream  5  is kept  constant  to  yield  a  polymer  with  the  required specifications.</p>
<p>0220 Make-up  components  are fed to the system  at spot 8  So  as  to  make  up  the  composition  of  recycle  stream  5. So, make-up  stream  8 will  include  the  triethyl  aluminum (TEAL)  that  directly  reacts  in  a ratio  of   moles  of  EAL er 2 T p mole of  catalyst. Also at the spot 8, propane is fed as the selected non-reactive compound required to maintain the total pressure of  the system.</p>
<p>0221) The  polymerization catalyst is introduced  as a  dry powder  by  a  catalyst  feeder  into  reactor  1 in  a  site within  the reaction Zone  3, close  to the distributing plate  9  in a rate to control  the  residence  time  of he  catalyst.  The  reactive  gases, t including ethylene and comonomers are introduced at the spot 10.</p>
<p>0222. The produced polymer is  discharged  from  the reaction Zone through a discharge system 11 that provides the recovery of  the reactive and non-reactive gases, recy cling said gases back  to the  recycle stream 5  at spot 12  and lowers the pressure of  the discharged mixture of  polymer and gases at certain pressure for later conveying the pro duced  polymer  particles 13 for downward  sampling.</p>
