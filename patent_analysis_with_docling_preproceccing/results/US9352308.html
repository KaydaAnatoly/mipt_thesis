<p>This application is a  Continuation-In-Part of  application Ser.  No.  10/518,443  filed  Jul. 1,  2005,  now  abandoned  which is the National  phase  of  PCT  International Application No. PCT/BR2002/000086  filed on  Jun. 19,  2002,  all of  which  are hereby  expressly incorporated by reference into the  present application.</p>

<p>The  present  invention  relates  to  a  solid  catalyst  component for ethylene polymerization and copolymerization, com posed  of  a  carrier  of articulate  silica  and  a  catalytically  active p portion  including titanium,  magnesium, chlorine,  alkoxy groups and at least one organometallic compound of the groups 1, 2, 12  or 13 of  the periodic table. The  process for producing  the  catalyst  of  the  present  invention  comprises  the steps of:</p>
<ul>
<li>(a) impregnating  an  activated silica particles with  a  solution ofan  organometallic  compound  of  the  groups  1, 2, 12  or  13 of  the  periodic  table, in an  inert  organic  solvent;</li>

</ul>
<p>2</p>
<p>Therefore,  it  is  crucial  for  the  process  that  the  catalyst  used enables  a  total  control  of he  polymer  morphology  resulting  in t product  grains  without  fines,  with  high  bulk  density  and  ood g flowing  properties.</p>
<p>Another very important aspect is that the catalyst must have a slow decaying time to permit the use of  reactors in series. This arrangement makes  possible the obtainment of bimodal products in addition to the reduction of  the total volume  of  the  reaction  for  the  same  production  basis. More over,  process  operations  with  a  different  condition  of eaction r in at least two  reactors in series, makes  possible the use of catalysts with higher particle size thereby minimizing the formation  of  electrostatic charges.</p>
<h2>2)  Polymer  Structure</h2>
<p>The catalyst properties are fundamental to the polymer structure,  mainly  with  respect  to  the  molecular  weight  distri bution, comonomer insertion in the polymeric chain and soluble  content.</p>
<p>Each  application  used  to  achieve  a  final  product  from  high density polyethylene  (HDPE)  or  linear  low  density  polyeth ylene  (LLDPE)  requires  a  specific polymeric  structure.</p>
<p>To obtain a film with improved optical and mechanical properties  and  avoid  blocking  problems,  a  polymer  having  a narrow  molecular  weight  distribution  (MFR&lt;27),  is required. A  large quantity of  LLDPE  applications requires products with a density=0.918 and a MI=0.7, and in most cases a xylene soluble content&lt;10% is  desired. Indeed, when the Xylene soluble content of  the polymer  is present in a  high concentration (&gt;10%)  and  with  a  low  molecular  weight,  this soluble content  tends to migrate  to the film Surface causing blocking,  in addition to the unsatisfactory optical properties (low  gloss  and  high haze).</p>
<p>3)  Ziegler-Natta Polyethylene  Catalyst</p>
<p>Due  to  the  strong  competition  existent  in  the  polyethylene market,  the  catalyst  production  cost  is  a  fundamental  compo nent.  Therefore  it is mandatory  that  the  catalyst  for  producing polyethylene be manufactured  by  a simple route, from low cost  raw  material,  without  generating  gaseous,  liquid  or  Solid</p>
<p>The  catalyst  component  obtained  is especially  suitable  for the  production  of  homo-  and  copolymers  of  ethylene  as nar row molecular  weight  distribution  high  density  polyethylene and  linear  low  density  polyethylene  with  controlled  morphol  45 ogy  and  improved  structure.</p>
<h2>BACKGROUND  OF  THE  INVENTION</h2>
<h2>1) Polymerization Process</h2>
<p>50</p>
<p>60</p>
<p>65</p>
<p>The slurry or gas phase processes for the production of HDPE  or  LLDPE  operating  with  low  bulk  density  polymers require reactors with large Volumes in order to obtain the necessary  residence  time. Particularly,  in  the  gas  phase  reac tors, the  presence  offines  with  low  bulk  density  causes  prob  55 lems. In fact, due to the friction of  the polymer  particles present in the reactor, the fines are especially prone to the formation of  electrostatic charges and tend to deposit and adhere  to the metallic walls. These  stagnant  deposits do not allow  the  exchange  of  the  reaction  heat  and  ecome ot  spots, b h which  can  form  layers  of  agglomerates  containing  eventually melt  polymer.  After  a  period  of ime  chunks  of gglomerates t a can fall down  and  plug  the product discharge system. The described effects are enhanced  when  the reaction is carried out  with  a  highly  active  catalyst.</p>
<p>In U.S. Pat. No. 5,410.002 a summary  of  patents on the above  described  phenomena  is presented.</p>
<p>U.S.  Pat. No.  5,585,317  describes the  synthesis of  a  cata lyst Supported on a magnesium chloride based carrier. The reported  examples  relates  to  the  production  of  polymers  hav ing good  morphology,  characterized  by  the  absence  of  fines and  by  the  high  bulk  density  which  is, for  LLDPE,  produced between  0.32  and  0.40  g/ml  and  for  HDPE,  between  0.33  and 0.438  g/ml.</p>
<p>U.S.  Pat. No.  5,188,997  describes  a  synthesis  process for Ziegler-Natta catalysts from silica and  magnesium  chloride alcoholate.  The  results  reported  demonstrate  that  this  catalyst produces  a  polymer  with  low  bulk  density  (0.23  to  0.30  g/ml) and  with  an  intermediate  molecular  weight  distribution  (MFR 30.0 to 37.8).</p>
<p>However, in the  case  of  LLDPE  production, the  polymer obtained  presents  an  undesired  comonomer  distribution  in  its chain,  evidenced  by  the  high  xylene  soluble  content  at  differ ent polymer  densities. As  an example, a polyethylene with 0.919  g/ml  of  polymer  density  has  a  xylene  soluble  content  of 12.5%  by  weight.</p>
