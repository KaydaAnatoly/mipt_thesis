<h2>POLYMERIZATION  CATALYST  AND  METHOD</h2>
<h2>BACKGROUND  OF  THE  INVENTION</h2>
<p>In this invention, the  polymerization catalysts  useful in polymerizing and copolymerizing 1-olefins are pre pared  by  the reaction of  silica or  alumina  with  a  func tional silane compound,  organomagnesium  compound, an alcohol, and a titanium, vanadium, zirconium or mixture of  these compounds.  These  catalysts are then activated, associating them with an organoaluminum cocatalyst.  These  catalyst  products  are  primarily  useful for  the  polymerization  of  1-olefins  such  as  ethylene  and the copolymerization of  these 1-olefins.</p>

O  sium compounds  but alkoxides and halides and other This  solid product  is suspended  in a  solution of  an  or ganometallic  compound,  which  may  be  an  alkyl  alumi num  or  silicon halide compound.  The  suspended solid component  may  be  used  as  is along  with  an  organome tallic compound  as a cocatalyst. The  suspended solid compound  can  also  be  filtered,  and  washed  prior  to  use, and  for  gas  phase  polymerization  it can  be  coated  with wax.  The  magnesium  compounds  are not  alkyl magne types  of  compounds.</p>

<p>One  of  the  features of  the  invention  is to provide  an improved method  of  polymerizing  with  these catalysts in the particle form  slurry, gas  phase  or  solution form polymerization processes.</p>

<p>Another  Schweier  patent,  German  Offen.  No. 2,721,094  is similar to  this one. It reveals that  the  silica or  silica-alumina  may e  treated  with  an  alkyl  aluminum b halide compound  beforehand.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>A  further feature is that the  higher  melt  index  poly mers  so  produced  are narrow  in molecular weight dis tribution and  are  therefore  highly  suitable  for  injection  25 molding  or  cast film applications.</p>
<p>Another  feature  of  the  invention  is  that  the  polymeri zation  reactions  promoted  by  the  improved  catalysts  are more readily modified by hydrogen so that desirable high melt  index  polymers  are easily made.</p>
<p>30</p>
<p>Yet  another feature of  the invention is to provide a catalyst  yielding  high  melt  index, high density  polyeth ylene  in  the  particle  form  process  without  reactor  foul 1ng.</p>
<p>U.S. Pat. No.  4,110,523,  8/29/78,  also  by  Schweier  et al., covers  a  similar catalyst. In this case, the  treatment with the alkyl aluminum or silicon halide solution is eliminated.</p>

<p>Still another  feature of  this invention is the  produc tion of  ethylene-1-alkene copolymers, commonly known  as  linear  low  density  polyethylene  (LLDPE),  by the catalyst of this invention. These copolymers can have  densities  from  0.915  to  0.960  g/cm3  nd  properties  35 a suitable  for  film  and  injection molding  applications,  for example.</p>

<p>K. Ziegler  first discovered  two  component  catalysts based  on  compounds  of  the Group  IVB-VIIB  metals  of the periodic table and an organometallic compound  40 products of  this invention. belonging  to  Groups  I-IIIA  of  the  periodic  table  for  the polymerization of  olefins. Since his discovery, numer ous  catalysts  have  been  disclosed  as  improvements  over the original Ziegler catalysts.  Most of  these catalyst systems  are  of  relatively  low  activity  and  stability.  They  45 require a costly catalyst removal  step.</p>
<p>One of the modifications attempted in an effort to increase  the  activity of  the Ziegler  type  catalyst  was  to deposit  the  catalyst  components  on  an  inert  support. In U.S. Pat. No.  2,981,725,  such  a  process  is  disclosed.  The  50 supports used were magnesium chloride, silicon car bide, silica gel, calcium  chloride, etc.</p>
<p>The  catalysts of  this invention  are  formed  from  four reactive materials. One  of  the reactive materials is the product  formed  by  the  interaction  of n  oxide  like  silica a or alumina with an organic silicon compound. This silane-treated  silica  or alumina is  combined with an organomagnesium compound, an alcohol, and a tita nium  or  vanadium  compound. From  the  resulting reac tion mixture, a solid, free-flowing  catalyst is separated. The  catalyst  so  formed  is activated  by  an  organoalumi num  compound.</p>

<p>The alcohol modification allows the production of higher  melt  index  polymers  in response  to  the  addition  5  sary. of  hydrogen  to  the  polymerization reaction.

<h2>DESCRIPTION  OF  THE  PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</h2>
<p>The  catalysts  of  this  invention  have  higher  melt  index capability and  reactivity than normal  Ziegler catalysts. These catalysts are simple to prepare and in the pre ferred method, are highly economical because of the lack of  necessity of  calcination, solvent washing, high</p>
<p>The  organic  silicon compound  must  have  at  least  one functional group  which  can react with  the surface hy droxyl  groups  of  the  silica or  alumina,  and  by  means  of this reaction the  organic  silicon residue  must  be  bonded to the surface of  the silica or alumina or mixtures of 50 these. Prior  to the  reaction  between  the  organic  silicon compound  and the silica or alumina, the silica or  alu mina  may  be  dried to  completely  remove  the  water  at  a temperature less than  about  800 C.  The  drying  may  be only partial so as to leave a  small amount  of  water  to  55  temperature  reaction, grinding, etc. catalyze the reaction of  the organic  silicon compound with the surface groups. Usually, it is preferred to at least partially remove  the  surface water  from  the  silica or  alumina.</p>
<p>The  amount  of  organic  silicon compound  may  be  in excess of  the reactive surface groups. In this case, the conversion of  the  surface groups  can  be  made  as  com plete as possible, and the unreacted excess can be re moved  by  distillation at less than  200° C., at  pressures less than one atmosphere if necessary, or by  heating combined  with  purging  with  an  inert  gas.  The  reaction product  of  the  silica  or  alumina  with  the  organic  silicon compound should not be heated above 300  C., since</p>
<p>In this invention, the silicon compound has one or more  reactive  groups  for  each  silicon atom  in  the  mole cule. One  of  these  reactive  groups  may  be  consumed  by a  surface reaction. Then  the  attached  silicon atom  may have no  reactive group  or  it could  have  some  reactive groups. The remaining reactive groups can interact with  the  magnesium  component  of  the  catalyst. By  such interaction, the polymerization reactions can be influ enced  toward  desirable  properties  in  the  polymer  prod ucts.</p>
<p>The  silicon compounds  useful in this invention have the following  structural formulae:</p>

The invention requires at least one  such reactive  group. If more  than  one  are  used,  they  may  be  the  same  or  differ ent. Examples  of  reactive groups  are -F,  -Cl,  --Br, -OCH3, -OCH2CH5, -NH2, -NCCH3)2, -N(H)Si(CH3)3, -CH2CH2CH2Cl,  -CH2CH2CH2NH2, -OCH2CH2OCH3, -O2CCH3, .  . . and -CH2CH2CH2SH. The R group is  a hydrocarbon group  containing  only  carbon  and  hydrogen.  It may  be, for example,  alkyl, phenyl, or  alkenyl such  as vinyl.</p>

When  more  than one R2  group  occurs in the 20 titanium compound, the groups can be the same or different.</p>
<p>The  silicas  or  aluminas  that  are  suitable  for  this  inven tion may  contain  minor  amounts  of  zirconia, magnesia, or titania.  For catalyst manufacture, it is preferred to have relatively finely divided silica or  alumina, which may  be  porous or  nonporous. .</p>
<p>Following  the  reaction  with  the  titanium  compound, it is necessary  to remove  the  excess  solvent  in order  to solvent is evaporated  and  collected.

<p>Prior  to reaction with  the  silane, the  silica or  alumina may  be  dried to completely remove  surface water  at a temperature less than 800° C. The  drying  may  instead be  only partial in some  cases in order  to leave a  small 25 Nonetheless, this invention includes amounts of tita amount of  water, or the drying  can  be  eliminated en tirely depending on the structure of  the organosilane compound. Usually, it is preferred to at least partially remove the surface water from the silica or alumina. Titanium  tetrachloride  is  a  preferred  compound.  The amount  of  titanium  compound  is  preferably  less  than  the amount equivalent  to  the  surface  reactive  groups. nium compound, which are from 1 to 200  percent of that equivalent  amount. For example, in the case of  hexamethyl disilazane, a 30  have a free-flowing catalyst.  In a preferred method, controlled  amount  of  water  on  silica catalyzes  the  reac tion of  hexamethyl  disilazane with silica.</p>
<p>The  amount  of  silane  compound  may lso  be  less  than a the stoichiometric equivalent of the reactive groups upon  the  silica or  alumina. In  this case,  all of  the  silane  45 compound  may  become  attached to the  surface  so  that no  removal  of  excess  is necessary.</p>
<p>The  amount  of  silane  compound  may  be  in excess  of the reactive groups  of  silica or  alumina  surface. When this  is  the  case,  the  conversion  of  the  surface  groups  can 35 fuging,  or  decantation  can  also be  practiced. be  made  as  complete  as  possible. The  unreacted  excess of  silicon compound  can  be  removed  by  distillation at less than 200  C.  at decreased pressure  if necessary, or by  heat  and  inert  gas  purging.  The  reaction product  of the silica  or alumina with the silane should not be  40  taining one or about ten carbon atoms and may be heated above 300  C., which might lead to thermal decomposition of  the  bonded  silane  groups.</p>

Com i plexes of  organomagnesium compounds with organo aluminum  halides  can  also  be  used.  The omplexes  may c contain small amounts of  aluminum or magnesium al koxides. is</p>
<p>The  alkyl aluminum cocatalyst can  be  chosen  from trialkyl aluminum  compounds  and alkyl aluminum  hy dride  compounds  and  their mixtures. The  alkyl  groups of  suitable cocatalysts have hydrocarbon chains con straight chained or  branched.  Triaryl aluminum com pounds may  also be used but because they are not so readily obtained as the alkyl compounds,  they  are not preferred. Examples  of  suitable  cocatalysts  are  triethyl aluminum,  trioctyl aluminum,  tri(2-methyl pentyl )aluminum and diethyl aluminum hydride. Trisobutyl aluminum and diisobutylaluminum hydride are espe cially preferred.  If  needed,  alkyl  aluminum  halides  may be used along with the alkyl aluminum compounds described above.</p>
<p>The cocatalyst may be fed to the polymerization reactor along with the above-described solid compo nent  in  the  same  or  preferably  separate  lines.  The  molar ratio of  the  cocatalyst  to  the  Group  IVB nd  VB etal a m compounds  in the  solid  component  can  be  from  0.1:1 to 100:1 although the  preferred range  is 1:1 to  20:1.</p>

A  1000 ml volume of  isobutane was  pressured into the vessel as a slurry medium,  and hydrogen was added to give a 100 psi pressure increase. During the polymerization tests, ethylene was fed as required to keep the total pressure constant  at 550  psig. TIBAL  at 9.2  mmoles  per  gram  was  the  catalyst.

<p>Davison Chemical grade  952  silica was  treated with hexamethyl disilazane. A  2.6 g  quantity of  the treated silica was  transferred  to  a  dry,  nitrogen-filled  flask. The silica was  stirred with  a  magnet  bar  for  one  hour  while a  flow  of  N2  was  passed  through  the  flask. Then  7.7 ml of  dibutyl magnesium-triethyl  aluminum  complex (Mg/Al=6.1) solution, 8.9 wt.% in heptane, 0.59 ml n-butyl alcohol, and 16.25 ml of heptane were added sequentially.

<h2>EXAMPLE  2</h2>
<p>Another  catalyst  was  made  as  described  in Example  1 except that the proportions of magnesium compound,  60 butyl alcohol,  and titanium  chloride were increased relative to the  silane-treated silica. In this example, the amount of titanium tetrachloride was 1.75  mmol per gram of  silane-treated silica instead of 1.25 mmol per gram. The Ti/Mg and alcohol to magnesium ratios  65 were  kept  equal to 1.0.</p>
<p>For  comparison,  a  catalyst  was  made  in the  same  way but  without the  addition of  the n-butyl alcohol.</p>
<p>Another  test  of  the  catalyst  of  Example  2  was  done  in the 2  l  pressure vessel but with only 50 psi hydrogen added instead of 100  psi.</p>
<p>This test gave an hourly catalyst reactivity of  5052 with  the product  having  a melt  index  of  2.4 and  an RD value  of  3.6. Previously,  a  comparison  catalyst  had  been made  in a  similar way  but without  silane-treated silica. in place of  the silane-treated Davison 952 silica,  ther mally treated silica was  used. The  temperature  of  treat ment was 600  C. This comparison catalyst gave an hourly  reactivity  of  224.5, a  melt  index  of  3.0, and  an  RD value of  4.5. The RD  value is a measure of  molecular weight distribution and was measured as described in the  article  in Polymer  Engineering  and  Science, Vol. II, pages 124-128  (1971).  The  lower  RD  value of  the  poly mer  produced  by  the  invention  catalyst  shows  the  prod uct to be more suitable for injection molding applica tions.</p>

The  amount of  trisobutyl aluminum solution was chosen to give  9.2 mmol/g  of  solid catalyst. The  tem perature  of  polymerization  was  160' F. After  the  isobu tane addition, hydrogen was added to give a 50 psi increase in pressure. Ethylene and 1-butene were then metered in over  a  period of  five to  seven minutes. Eth ylene was  added  as required to give  a total pressure of 350 psig while the amount  of 1-butene added was ap proximately 22 wt.% of the reaction vessel contents. The  reactions  were  continued  for  one  hour  after the  350 psig total pressure was attained.  During this hour an additional 15 g  quantity ofbutene  was  added  to replace the portion polymerized.</p>
<p>The results of the tests showed that the invention catalyst gave a low density copolymer with superior melt  elasticity.  The  invention  catalyst  also  gave  a  higher melt index and reactivity:</p>
