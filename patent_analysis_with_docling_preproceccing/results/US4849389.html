Additionally,  LLDPE resins  having such When the LLDPE  resins are fabricated into injec tion-molded products, it  is  imperative to assure that such  products  are  not  susceptible to warping  or  shrink ing.  As  is known  to  those  skilled  in  the  art,  the  degree  of warping  or  shrinking  can  be  predicted  from  the  molecu tively narrow molecular weight distribution produce injection-molded products exhibiting a minimum amount of warping or shrinkage. Conversely, resins having relatively broad molecular weight distribution dergo  warping  or  shrinkage.  One  of  the  measures  of  the molecular weight distribution of  the resin is melt flow ratio (MFR),  the ratio of  high melt  flow  index  (HLMI or  I21)  to  melt  index  (I2)  for  a  given  resin.  The  melt  flow weight  distribution of  the  polymer,  the  higher  the  MFR value, the broader the molecular weight distribution.

<p>It is therefore a  primary  object of  the  present inven tion  to  provide  a  high  activity  catalyst  for  the  polymeri zation of  alpha-olefins yielding  products of  a relatively 20  previously-known  catalyst  compositions,  e.g.,  those narrow molecular weight distribution which is main tained substantially constant with varying amounts of the co-catalyst concentration. 15  compositions of  this invention are linear polyethylenes The  polymers  prepared  in the  presence  of  the  catalyst which  are  homopolymers  of  ethylene or  copolymers  of ethylene  and  higher  alpha-olefins. The  polymers  exhibit relatively low  values  of  melt  flow  ratio (MFR),  as com pared to similar polymers prepared in the presence of disclosed by Nowlin et al,  U.S.  Pat.  No. 4,481,301. Thus,  the  polymers  prepared  with  the  catalyst  composi tions of this invention are especially suitable for the production of  films and  injection molding  applications.</p>
<p>It is another object of  the present invention to pro vide a high activity catalyst composition which pro- 25 duces  alpha-olefin polymers  having relatively low  hex ane extractables.</p>
<p>Catalysts produced according to the present inven tion  are described below in  terms of the manner in which they are made.</p>
<p>It is an additional object of  the present invention to provide  a  catalytic process for polymerizing  alpha-ole fins which yields linear low  density polyethylene of  a 30 relatively narrow  molecular  weight  distribution at high productivity rates.</p>
<h2>CATALYST  SYNTHESIS</h2>
<h2>SUMMARY  OF  THE  INVENTION</h2>
<p>A Supported  alpha-olefin  polymerization  catalyst composition of  this invention  is prepared  in a  multi-step process. In the first step, a mixture of  a solid, porous carrier  and  a  non-polar  solvent  is contacted  with  at  least one organomagnesium composition of  the formula</p>

<div class="formula-not-decoded">Formula not decoded</div>
<p>where R  and R are the same  or  different CA-C12  alkyl groups, n  and n are each 0,  1  and 2, providing that m--n  equals the valence of  Mg.  Subsequently, the  mix ture of  the  first step  is contacted  with  at least one  com pound  of  formula (II), R2-OH,  where R2  is a C1-C10 alkyl or  a  C1-C10  halogenated  alkyl. The  resulting mix ture  is then  contacted with  at  least one  transition metal compound  soluble in the non-polar  solvent. The  prod uct  is dried  and  it is activated catalyst composition has very high productivity in the polymerization of  alpha olefins, very effective higher comonomer  (i.e., C3-C10 alpha-olefin) incorporation properties and it produces 55 polymers having relatively narrow molecular weight distribution and  low  hexane  extractables.</p>
<p>35  silicon and/or  aluminum.  The  carrier  materials  are  used 45  about  600  C.  When  the  carrier  is silica, it is heated at a 50  tion of  this invention. The carrier  materials are usually inorganic,  solid, particulate  porous  materials  which  are  inert  to  the  other components  of  the  catalyst  composition  and  to  the  other active  components  of  the  reaction  system.  These  carrier materials include such inorganic materials as oxides of in the  form  of  dry  powders  having  an  average particle size of  from  about 1  micron  to about  250  microns,  pref erably  from  about  10  microns  to  about 150  microns.  The carrier  materials  are  also  porous  and  have  a  surface  area of  at  least  about  3  square  meters  per  gram,  and  prefera bly  at  least  about  50  square  meters  per  gram.  The arrier c material should be  dry, that is, free of  absorbed water. Drying  of  the carrier material can  be  effected by  heat ing at about 100  to about 1000  C. and preferably at temperature  of  at least  200 C.,  preferably  at  about  200 to about  850  C., and most  preferably at about 600  C. The carrier material  must have at least some active hydroxyl  (OH)  groups  to  produce  the  catalyst composi</p>

<p>In  the  most  preferred  embodiment,  the  carrier  is silica which, prior to the  use thereof  in the  first catalyst syn thesis step, has  been dehydrated by fluidizing with ni trogen and  heating  at about  600  C.  for  about 16  hours to achieve a surface hydroxyl concentration of  about 0.7 mmols/gm.  The  silica  of  the  most  preferred  embodi ment is a high surface area, amorphous  silica (surface area=300  m2/gm;  pore  volume  of  1.65 cm/gm),  and  it is material marketed under  the tradenames of  Davison 952  or Davison 955  by  the Davison Chemical Division of  W.R.  Grace  and Company.  The  silica is in the form of  spherical  particles,  e.g., as  obtained  by  a  spray-drying process.</p>

<p>The  carrier material is slurried in a  non-polar  solvent and the resulting slurry is contacted with at least one organomagnesium composition having the empirical formula (I).  The slurry of  the carrier material in the solvent is prepared  by  introducing the carrier material</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>into the solvent, preferably while  stirring, and heating the mixture is about 25  to about 100  C., preferably about 40  to about  60°  C.  The  slurry is then contacted with the aforementioned organomagnesium composi tion, while the heating is continued at the aforemen tioned temperature.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>nesium  composition  added  to  the  slurry is such  that the molar ratio of  Mg  to the hydroxyl  groups  (OH)  on  the solid carrier is about 1:1 to about  6:1, preferably about 2:1 to about 4:1, more  preferably about 2.5:1 to about 3.5:1 and  most  preferably  about  3:1, depending  upon  the temperature at which the carrier material was dried. The organomagnesium composition  dissolves  in  the non-polar solvent to form  a  solution.</p>
<p>O  ganomagnesium  composition which  is in excess of  that It is also possible to add such an amount  of  the or which will be  deposited onto the support and then re move, e.g., by  filtration and  washing,  any  excess of  the organomagnesium composition. However,  this alterna tive is less desirable than the most preferred embodi ment  described above.</p>
<p>The  organomagnesium  composition  has  the  empirical formula Rin Mg  R", where R  and R' are the same  or different C4-C12  alkyl groups, preferably C4-C10  alkyl groups,  more preferably  C4-C8 unsubstituted  alkyl groups, and  most  preferably  both R nd R' are n-butyl a groups, and m  and  n  are each 0, 1  or  2, providing  that m-n  is equal to the valence of  Mg.</p>
<p>Suitable non-polar  solvents  are materials  in which  all of  the  reactants  used  herein, i.e., the  organomagnesium  15 composition, the compound of formula (II)  and the transition metal  compounds  are  at least partially  soluble and  which  are  liquid  at  reaction  temperatures. Preferred non-polar solvents are alkanes, such as hexane, n-hep tane, octane, nonane, and  decane,  although  a  variety of  20 other materials including cycloalkanes, such as cyclo hexane, aromatics, such as benzene and ethylbenzene can  be  employed.  The  most  preferred non-polar  solvent is hexane. Prior  to use, the non-polar  solvent  should  be purified, such  as by  percolation through silica gel and  25 /or molecular sieves, to remove traces of  water, oxy gen, polar compounds, and other materials capable of adversely  affecting catalyst activity.</p>
<p>In  the  most  preferred embodiment  of  the  synthesis  of this catalyst it is important  to  add  only  such  an  amount  30 of the  organomagnesium  composition  that  will  be deposited-physically or  chemically--onto  the  support since any  excess of  the organomagnesium  composition in the solution may  react with other synthesis chemi cals, and  precipitate outside  of  the  support.  The  carrier  35 drying temperature affects the number  of  sites on the carrier available for the  organomagnesium composi tion-the  higher the drying temperature the lower  the number of  sites. Thus,  the exact molar ratio of  the or ganomagnesium composition to the hydroxyl groups will vary and must be determined on a case-by-case basis to assure that only so much of the ogranomag nesium composition is added  to the solution as will be deposited onto  the support without leaving  any  excess of  the organomagnesium composition in the solution.  45 Furthermore,  it is believed that  the molar  amout  of  the organomagnesium composition deposited onto  the sup port is greater than the molar  content of  the hydroxyl groups on the support. Thus, the molar ratios given guideline and the  exact amount of the organomag nesium composition in this embodiment must  be con trolled  by  the  functional  limitation discussed  above,  i.e., it must  not  be  greater  than  that  which  can  be  deposited onto  the  support. If  greater  than  the  amount  is added  to  55 the  solvent,  the  excess  may  react  with  the  compound  of formula (II), thereby forming a precipitate outside of the  support  which  is detrimental  in  the  synthesis  of  our catalyst and must  be avoided. The  amount of  the or that deposited onto the support can be determined in any  conventional  manner,  e.g.,  by adding  the  or ganomagnesium  composition  to  the  slurry  of  the  carrier in  the solvent, while stirring the slurry, until the or the  solvent.</p>
<p>After  the  addition of  the  organomagnesium  composi tion to the slurry is completed, the slurry is contacted with at least one  compound  of  the  formula  (II)</p>
<div class="formula-not-decoded">Formula not decoded</div>

Thus,  the  compound  of formula (II) is preferably an  alcohol and most  prefera bly ethanol. The  amount  of  the compound  of  formula (II) used in this synthesis step is sufficient to convert substantially all  of the magnesium alkyl  (Mg-R  or MgR) groups on the carrier  to  magnesium alkoxy (MgO R') groups.  In a preferred embodiment, the amount  of  the  formula  (II) compound  added  is such  that substantially no excess thereof is present in the non polar solvent after substantially all  of the magnesium alkyl groups are converted to the magnesium alkoxy groups on the carrier to prevent the reaction of the formula (II) compound  with the transition metal com pound  outside  of  the  carrier. This  synthesis  step  is con ducted  at about  25  to  about  65° C.,  preferably  at  about 30 to  about  55  C., and  most  preferably  at  about  30  to about  40  C.</p>

This  synthesis  step  is conducted  at  about  25  to about 65°  C., preferably at about 30  to about 55  C., and most preferably at about 30  to about 40° C. In a metal compound  added  is not greater than that which can  be  deposited  onto  the  carrier.  The  exact  molar  ratio of  Mg  to  the  transition metal  and  of  the  transition metal to  the  hydroxyl  groups  of  the  carrier  will  therefore  vary (depending,  e.g., on  the  carrier  drying  temperature)  and must  be  determined on  a  case-by-case basis. For  exam ple, for  the  silica  carrier  heated  at  about  200  to 850 C., the amount of  the transition metal compound is such that  the  molar  ratio  of he  transition metal,  derived  from t of  the  carrier is about 1  to about  2.0, preferably about 1.5 to  about  2.0  and  the  molar  ratio  of Mg  to the  transi tion metal is about 1 to about 3, preferably about 2 to about 3. We  found that these molar ratios produce a relatively low  melt  flow  ratio  (MFR)  values  of  about  20 to  about  35.

<p>The  linear polyethylene  polymers  prepared  in accor dance  with the  present  invention are  homopolymers  of ethylene or copolymers of  ethylene with one or more C3-C10 alpha-olefins.  Thus, copolymers having two monomeric units are possible as well as terpolymers having three monomeric units. Particular examples of such polymers include ethylene/1-butene copolymers,  30 ethylene/1-hexene copolymers, ethylene/1-octene co polymers, ethylene/4-methyl-1-pentene  copolymers, ethylene/1-butene/1-hexane  terpolymers,  ethylene/propylene/1-hexane terpolymers and ethylene/propylene/1-butene terpolymers. When propylene is employed as a comonomer, the resulting linear low density polyethylene polymer preferably has at least one  other  alpha-olefin comonomer  having  at least four carbon atoms in an amount of at least  1  percent by weight of  the polymer. Accordingly, ethylene/propy lene copolymers are possible, but not preferred. The most  preferred comonomer  is 1-hexene. 25</p>

Table III summarizes the catalyst  reactivity ratios with 1-hexene  as  a  function of  alcohol used  or  a  transi tion metal compound on the precursor synthesis and activator. TABLE  III 30 45  prepared with the ethanol-based catalysts. FIG. 3 shows  a similar trend for other catalysts (of Examples 1, 2, 6  and  7)  prepared  with  different  alcohols with TEAL  or TMA  as a cocatalyst.  However, the copolymer  prepared with an alcohol-free catalyst pro vided the  broadest  MWD,  as  indicated by  MFR alues v catalysts synthesized with alcohol gave MFR  values ranging from  about  27  to  about  35, depending  on  alco hol type  and  cocatalyst. Thus, catalysts based on  etha nol and TMA  give copolymers with the narrowest MWD.  Catalysts  based  on  methanol  and  2,2,2-trichloro ethanol produce copolymers with MFR  values in the 32-37 range depending on density and cocatalyst. At the same density, these catalysts give products with MFR  values about 2-6 units higher than copolymers</p>
