A magnesium supported on said silica, said tetravalent titanium compound  being soluble in said liquid me dium, and said supported magnesium composition, It is desirable  to remove  physically  bound  water  from the carrier material prior to contacting this material with  water-reactive  magnesium  compounds.  This  water removal may  be accomplished by heating the carrier material to a temperature from about 100°  C. to an upper  limit of  temperature represented  by  the  tempera suitable range  of  temperatures  may,  thus,  be  from  about 100° C. to about 800° C., e.g., from about 150° C. to about  250  C. w</p>
<p>Suitable carrier materials which may  be treated in clude  solid, porous  carrier materials  such  as  silica, alu mina  and  combinations  thereof. Such  carrier materials may  be  amorphous  or  crystalline  in  form.  These  carriers may  be  in  the  form  of articles  having  a  particle size  of p from  about  0.1 micron  to  about  200  microns,  more  pref erably from  about 10  to about 80  microns. Preferably, the carrier is in the form of spherical particles, e.g., spray  dried  silica. The  internal  porosity  of  these  carriers may  be  larger  than  0.2  cm/gm,  e.g., larger than  about 0.6 cm/g.  The  specific surface area of  these carriers may  be  larger than  about  50  m2/g,  e.g., from  about 150 to about 1500  m2/g.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>Chemically bound water, as represented by  a pres ence  of  OH roups  in the carrier, may  be  present  when g the  carrier  is contacted  with  water-reactive magnesium compounds  in accordance  with  an  aspect  of  the  present invention.  This  chemically  bound  water  may  be  present as  about  0.3 mmoles  or  more  of OH  groups  per  gram  of carrier.  Accordingly,  an  amount  of,  e.g., from  about  0.5 to about 5 mmoles of  OH  groups per gram of  carrier may  be  present, but  a  preferred range  is from  about  0.3 to  about  0.7  mmoles  of  OH roups  per  gram  of  carrier. g Excess OH  groups present in the carrier may  be re moved  by  heating the carrier for a  sufficient time  at  a sufficient temperature to accomplish the desired re moval.  More particularly,  for example, a relatively small number  of  OH roups  may  be removed  by  suffi  15 g cient heating at from about 150  C. to about 250  C., whereas  a  relatively  large  number  of  OH  roups  may e g b removed  by  sufficient  heating  at  at  least  500 or  600 C., most  especially,  about  from  about  750° C.  to  about  850' C. The  duration of  heating may  be  overnight, e.g., 16 2O. to the formula R,MgR'(2-)  is ethylmagnesium chlo hours or a shorter period, e.g., at least 4  hours. The surface hydroxyl concentration of  silica may  be  deter mined  according  to  J. B. Peri  and  A.  L. Hensley,  Jr.,  J. Phys. Chem,  72  (8), 2926  (1968). O  groups.  Accordingly,  stable  organic  moieties  as  defined Grignard reagents are described in Organic Chemis try, Second Edition,  Morrison  and  Boyd,  fifth printing, May  1968, pp. 112-114  and  516-521. Grignard reagents are  known  to react with organic molecules  or  moieties which  have  hydrogen  bonded  directly to a  nitrogen or oxygen  atom. Furthermore, Grignard reagents  are  also known to react with organic molecules or moieties containing carbonyl groups, cyano groups and nitro by  R  in the  above-mentioned  formula  generally would not  have  any  of  the  above-mentioned  groups  indicated as being  reactive with  Grignard reagents. Thus,  exam ples of R  and R' include C1-C12  hydrocarbyl groups (e.g., C1-C12  alkyl or C6-C12  aryl) or C1-C12  alkoxy groups,  which  may  be  unsubstituted  or  substituted,  e.g., with one or more of halogen (e.g.,  F, Cl,  Br or I), C1-C12  alkoxy,  etc. A referred  composition  according p ride.</p>

<p>While  heating  is a  preferred means  of  removing  OH  5 groups inherently present in a carrier such as silica, other removal  means  are  also  possible  such  as  chemical means.  For  example,  a  desired  proportion  of  OH roups g may  be reacted with a chemical agent such as a hy droxyl reactive aluminum  compound,  e.g., triethylalu 30 are intended to be encompassed within the formula 2</p>
<p>Examples of  suitable carrier materials are described in  the  Graff, U.S. Pat. No.  4,173,547. Note  particularly the  passage  extending  from  column  3, line  62  to  column 5, line 44  of  this Graff  patent. It is noted  that  internal  35 porosity of  carriers can be  determined by  a technique termed BET-technique, described by S. Brunauer, P. Emmett  and  E.  Teller  in  Journal  of  the  American  Chemi cal  Society, 60,  pp.  209-319  (1938).  Specific  surface  areas of  carriers  can  also  be  measured  in  accordance  with  the above-mentioned BET-technique, with  use  of  the  stan dardized method as described in British Standards BS 4359,  Volume  1, (1969).</p>
<p>It  is noted  that  even  a  Grignard  reagent  of  ethylmag nesium chloride may  contain a mixture of molecules other  than  ethylmagnesium  chloride, per  se. For  exam ple, particularly under  the influence of  various liquids or solvent systems, ethylmagnesium chloride may  dis proportionate to form essentially a mixture of  magne sium dichloride and diethylmagnesium. Such mixtures RMgR'2  in). Accordingly, it will be understood that compositions  of  the  formula  R,MgR'(2-m)  and  composi tions representative  thereof  are  intended  herein to rep resent the  overall empirical formula  of  these composi tions rather than  to  set forth the  molecular  formula of these  compositions.</p>
<p>Further  examples  of  carrier  materials  are  given  in  the Stevens  et  al., U.S.  Pat. No.  3,718,636.  Note  particularly the  passage  extending  from  line 12  to  line 29  of  column 3  of his  Stevens  etal  patent. Also  included  as  examples t of  carrier  materials  are  polymeric  silicas  known  as  poly siloxanes.</p>
<p>An  example  of  a  preferred  carrier  is silica which  has  50 been  dehydrated  by  fluidizing with nitrogen and  heat ing at about 800  C. for about 16 hours to achieve a surface hydroxyl  concentration of  about  0.5 mmols/g. The  silica used may  be  a  high  surface  area, amorphous silica  (surface  area=300  m2/g;  pore  volume  of  1.65  cm3  55  Examples  of  such ethers are mentioned on  column  4, per  gram)  marketed  under  the tradename  Davison  952 by  the  Davison  Division of  W.  R. Grace  and  Co. A  suitable  dehydrated  carrier  material  may e  further b treated by  impregnating  same  with  a solid magnesium containing composition which is capable of reacting with  a  tetravalent titanium compound.  One  such mag nesium containing  material  is  an organomagnesium composition  of  the  formula  RMgR'(2-m),  where  R nd a R"  are  the  same  or  different  and  represent  stable  organic moieties,  provided  that  R'  may lso  be  halogen,  and  n  is  65  atom  to  act  as  a  Lewis  acid  and  to  associate  with  at  least a a rational number from about 0.5 to 2. A  particular example of a solution of such an organomagnesium composition is a  Grignard reagent, Organo-magnesium compositions corresponding to those found in Grignard reagents have the formula RMgX,  where R  is as defined hereinabove and X  is halogen, (e.g., Cl, Br or I), and  are soluble in ethers. . lines  32-49 of the Yamaguchi et al.  U.S.  Pat.  No. 3,989,881 and  include aliphatic ethers, such  as diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether, dibutyl ether, dipentyl ether and  ethyl-n-butyl ether  and  cyclic  ethers  such  as  tetra hydrofuran  and  dioxane. It has  been  theorized that  the reason  for  the  ability of  such  ethers (e.g., diethyl ether to  solubilize  such  organomagnesium  compositions  (e.g., C2H5MgCl)  is by  virtue  of  the  ability of  the  magnesium one  electron  pair  from  the  etheric  oxygen  which  acts  as a Lewis base. Such an association is  represented as follows:</p>
<p>Preferably, the carrier should be  impregnated such that  the  pores  of  same  contain  reactive  solid  magnesium containing composition. A  preferred means  of  accom plishing  this result  is  by  incorporating  a  porous  carrier in a  liquid medium  containing  a  dissolved organomag nesium  composition  of  the  formula  R,MgR'(2-)  and  to cause  magnesium  to  become  impregnated  into  the  pores of  the  carrier  by  (1)  a  reaction  of he  organomagnesium t composition with the carrier, by  (2) a precipitation of magnesium from the organomagnesium composition onto  the  carrier  or  by  (3)  a  combination  of uch  reaction s and  precipitation.</p>

<p>Another  means  of  incorporating a  magnesium  com position  onto  a  carrier  is  to  precipitate  magnesium  from an  organomagnesium  composition  from  a  liquid onto  a carrier. This  precipitation may  take  place  by  any  possi ble  convenient  means  including  cooling  of  the  solvent, using  a  sufficiently large  amount  of  non-solvent  in the initial slurry,  adding  non-solvent  to  the  slurry  or  strip ping  off  solvent.  In  the  case  of  arrier  slurry  where he ac t liquid medium  is essentially a  hexane/tetrahydrofuran solution of  ethylmagnesium  chloride, it is preferred to precipitate  ethylmagnesium  chloride  onto  the  carrier  by distillation  of he  solvent. In  this  regard,  it  is  noted  that t tetrahydrofuran and hexane have nearly equivalent boiling points. Thus, it would  be  expected  that during the  course  of  distilling  these  solvents,  the  ratio  of etra t hydrofuran  to hexane  in the  liquid state  would  remain essentially constant. On  the other  hand, if the  boiling point  of  the  co-solvent  is significantly  greater  than  the boiling point  of  the  ether, then  the relative concentra tion  of o-solvent  may  increase  appreciably  as  the  distill c lation  proceeds.  In  such  a  case,  a  non-uniform  precipita tion  of agnesium  may  occur,  such  that  any  magnesium m dihalide which is present tends to precipitate before organomagnesium  is precipitated.</p>
<p>Although organomagnesium compounds  of  the for mula RMgX  tend to be insoluble in non-Lewis base solvents  such  as  hexane,  these organomagnesium  com pounds may  be completely soluble in mixed solvent systems  such  as  hexane/tetrahydrofuran,  provided  that a  sufficient  solubilizing amount  of  the Lewis  base  sol vent is present. Thus,  according to one  aspect of  the present invention, a  carrier may  be  slurried in a non Lewis  base  co-solvent  and  an  organomagnesium  com pound may  be added thereto in the form of  an  ether solution thereof. Examples of  non-Lewis base co-sol vents  are  given  in  the  passage  extending  from  column  6, line 61 to column  7, line 8 of  the Graff  U.S. Pat. No. 4,173,547. These  co-solvents  include  straight or branched saturated aliphatic  hydrocarbons, such as butanes,  pentanes, hexanes, heptanes, or commonly available  mixtures  thereof,  generally  known s  gasoline, a kerosene,  gas,  oil  or  other  petroleum  fractions. Further, such  co-solvents  include cyclic hydrocarbons, such  as cyclopentane,  cyclohexane,  methylcyclohexane,  as  well as  aromatic  hydrocarbons,  such  as  benzene  or  halogen aromatic hydrocarbons such as chlorobenzene.  It is noted  that  such  co-solvents  should  preferably not  con  30 tain groups which are reactive with the organomag nesium composition. A  preferred co-solvent is n-hex 2. O 15 20 25</p>
<p>Accordingly, it  may be possible to incorporate a magnesium composition onto a carrier by reacting an organomagnesium  composition  with  reactive  OH groups  of  the  carrier.</p>
<p>According  to  another  aspect  of  the  present  invention, carrier  is  impregnated  with  magnesium  composition  by suitably  contacting  this  carrier  with  a  liquid  containing organomagnesium composition of the formula RMgR'2-)  in  a  partially  dissolved  state. More artic p ularly, the  carrier  may  be  slurried  in  one  of  the  above exemplified non-Lewis  base co-solvents, such as hex  40 Examples of  such reaction products are given in the ane,  and  a  solution  of  Grignard  in ether  may  be  added thereto, the  amount  of  ether relative to the  amount  of co-solvent  being  sufficient to only partially solubilize the  Grignard.  The  non-soluble  portion  of he  Grignard t 35 Particularly  in  view  of he  above  discussion,  it  will  be t understood that at least three possible types of  sup ported magnesium  compositions can  be  obtained. The first type is essentially a reaction product of  an or ganomagnesium  composition  with  a  carrier  having  OH functionalities  which  are  reactive  with  this  organomag nesium  composition.  This  product  would  contain  essen tially no precipitated organomagnesium composition. may  be  in  the  form  of  dihalomagnesium,  the  amount  of  45  This product would contain essentially no reaction this  non-soluble  dihalomagnesium  being  essentially equivalent  to  an  mount  of  dialkylmagnesium  remaining a soluble  in the  solvent/co-solvent  mixture. aforementioned Stevens et al U.S. Pat.

<p>It  is noted  that  if  the  organomagnesium  compound  is only  sparingly  soluble,  e.g., to  the  extent  of ven  l per  50 e cent or less, reactive organomagnesium which is con sumed  by  reactive  sites on  the  carrier  will  be  replaced by  further  dissolution  of ndissolved  organomagnesium u by  a  mass  action  effect.</p>
<p>A second type of product is  essentially  an or ganomagnesium composition supported on a carrier. product  of  organomagnesium  with the carrier. Such  a product could result when  an  organomagnesium  com position  is  precipitated  onto  a  carrier  having  essentially no OH  functionalities reactive with the organomag nesium  composition.</p>
<p>65  used,  this  ratio  may e,  e.g.,  from  about  1.1 to  about  2.5. Accordingly,  magnesium  may  be  incorporated  onto  a carrier  in  either  an  unreacted  form  or  in  a  reacted  form, this reaction taking place between reactive hydroxyl groups  of  the  carrier  and  an  organomagnesium  compo sition. The  molar  ratio of  organomagnesium  composi tion used  to  impregnate  the  carrier  with respect  to the hydroxyl  groups  of he  carrier  may  be,  e.g.,  from  about t 0.5 to  about  3. When  an  excess  of  organomagnesium  is b slurry the carrier in a Lewis  base solvent such as an ether and to add a solution of  organomagnesium in ether to this slurry, the addition of organomagnesi um/ether  solution to  ether  or  co-solvent/carrier  slurry may  take  place  as  a  gradual  continuous  dropwise  addi tion  while  the  liquid  medium  of he  slurry  is maintained t under  reflux  conditions. Upon  such  addition,  dissolved organomagnesium  composition  may  react  with  the  car rier  at  the  site  of eactive  OH roups,  if  any,  appearing r g on  the  available  surface  area  of he  carrier.  Such  a  eac t r tion may  be demonstrated with respect to ethylmag nesium chloride  as  follows:</p>

<p>may,  optionally,  be  in  the  form  of   complex  with  one  or a more  electron donating  agents (i.e. Lewis  bases). More particularly, when  ethylmagnesium chloride is precipi tated  from a hexane/tetrahydrofuran solution,  each mole  of  ethylmagnesium chloride precipitated may  be complexed  with  approximately  one  mole  of  tetrahydro furan.  In more general terms, when an organomag nesium  composition  is precipitated from  a  solution con taining an ether, the resulting precipitate  may have t organomagnesium composition.</p>

More  particularly, for example, from about 0.1  to about 5 or even 50 mmoles  of  magnesium  may  be  impregnated  per  gram  of carrier initially present. When  a liquid containing an organomagnesium composition  is contacted  with  a  car  20  U.S. Pat. No.  4,302,566, the  particle  size  and  morphol rier the  amount  of  magnesium  in this liquid in  terms  of mmoles  may  be  essentially the  same  as  that  stated  above with respect to that which is  impregnated onto the carrier. It  is  particularly  noted that  mechanical shearing means  such  as  ball milling  are  not  necessary  to  achieve accordance with aspects of  the present invention. Ac cordingly, a ball milling process such as described in Examples 2-5 of  the Grant U.S. Pat. No. 3,821,186 is unnecessary and may be avoided. Moreover, a ball morphology  of  the  carrier. Since  catalysts made  in ac cordance  with  aspects  of  the  present  invention  are  pref erably capable of  being used in  gas phase, fluid bed polymerizations, e.g., as described in the Karol et al ogy  of  the  catalyst  may  e  rather  critical. Accordingly, b another reason for avoiding  ball milling is to preserve the  particle  size  and  morphology  of  the  carrier while  it is being  treated in accordance  with  aspects  of  the  pres containing essentially  no ether.  It  is  also possible to combine  carrier  and  a  solid  organomagnesium  composi tion in  the  absence  of  a  solvent  by  means  of  a  ball mill ing  device. However,  such  a  ball milling  process  is less preferred,  particularly  because  it does  not  tend  to  effec tively  incorporate  a  reactive  magnesium  compound  into the pores  of  the carrier.</p>
<p>When  a non-Lewis base co-solvent is used to slurry  25  ent  invention. the carrier, an amount  of  such co-solvent  sufficient to slurry  such  carrier may  be  used. More  particularly, for example, from  about  2  to  about 100  mls  of  such  co-sol vent may  be  present per gram  of  carrier. A referred p narrower  range  would  be  from  about  5  to  about 15  mls  30  ods  neither  the  carrier nor  the  magnesium  is contacted of  co-solvent  per  gram  of  carrier.</p>
<p>The  solid  supported  magnesium-containing  composi tion is preferably in the form  of  a  free-flowing  powder when  dry. It is  particularly  noted  that  when  a  carrier  is impregnated by  many  of  the above-exemplified meth with  either  an  organoaluminum  compound  or  an  alumi num  halide compound. Thus, such a  treatment with a significant  amount  of  an  organoaluminum  compound  or an  aluminum  halide  compound  is preferably  not  part  of</p>

However,  when  15  g  of silica are  slurried in 200  ml  of  n-hexane  and  50  ml  of  a 2.0 molar  solution of  ethylmagnesium  chloride  in tetra hydrofuran  is added  thereto  in  accordance  with Exam ple 1  given herein, infra, the ethylmagnesium  chloride  60  above-mentioned reactions  lead  to the  incorporation of appears  to  be  only  partially  soluble  in  the  n-hexane/tet rahydrofuran mixture.

Thus,  this  amount is  dependent  upon  many  factors  such  as  the  composition of  solvents and organomagnesium, the temperature of the  co-solvent/solvent  system, etc. However,  it will  be readily  understood  that  the  selection of  proper  amounts  40  soluble  in  this  liquid reaction  medium,  while  the  treated and concentrations  of organomagnesium/ether solu tions  is well  within  the  ability of  those  of  ordinary  skill in the art.  More particularly, for example, when an ethylmagnesium chloride/tetrahydrofuran solution  is added to a  hexane/carrier slurry, the concentration of  45  composition  is a reaction of  a  solid with a  liquid. It is the ethylmagnesium chloride/tetrahydrofuran solution may  be  from  about  0.1 to  about 10  Molar. A referred p narrower  range  would  be  from  about  1 to  about  3  Mo lar. A  carrier  treated  with  an  organomagnesium  composi tion according  to the above-exemplified methods may be reacted with a tetravalent titanium compound  in a liquid medium. The  tetravalent titanium compound  is carrier,  including the magnesium containing portion thereof, is  insoluble in  this  liquid  reaction  medium.

For instance, it  is  possible to precipitate  a  dialkylmagnesium  composition  onto  a  car rier  from a hydrocarbyl or halohydrocarbyl solvent Examples  of  tetravalent titanium compounds,  which may  be  used  in the  liquid reaction medium,  are  given  in 6 of  the Graff  U.S. Pat.

<p>It may  also be  possible to replace some  or  all of  the above-mentioned tetravalent titanium compounds  with  5 one or more other transition metal compounds. Such other  transition  metal  compounds  are  exemplified  in  the passage  extending  from  line  55  to  line  60  of  olumn  6  of c the  Graffetal  U.S. Pat. No.  4,173,547.

More  particularly,  for  example,  the molar  ratio of  tetravalent  titanium  to  organomagnesium may be from about 1  to about 10, more particularly from  about  3  to about  6.

<p>As described  in  the  Karol  et  al  U.S.  Pat.  No. 4,302,566, a preferred process for conducting a gas phase, fluid bed  polymerization is as  follows.</p>
<p>The  polymerization  reaction  is conducted  by  contact ing  a  stream of  the monomers,  in a  gas  phase  process,  10  cal in nature to the  polymer  to be  formed  or  different such as in the fluid bed  process described below, and substantially in the  absence  of  catalyst poisons  such  as moisture, oxygen,  CO,  CO2,  and  acetylene  with  a  cata lytically effective amount  of  the completely activated catalyst  at a  temperature  and  at  a  pressure  sufficient to  15 initiate the  polymerization reaction. .:*</p>
<p>It  is essential  that  the  bed  always  contains  particles  to prevent the formation of  localized "hot spots' and to entrap  and  distribute  the  particulate  catalyst  throughout the reaction zone.  On  start up,  the  reaction  zone  is usu ally  charged  with  a  base  of articulate  polymer  particles p before  gas  flow  is  initiated.  Such  particles  may e  identi b therefrom. When  different, they are withdrawn with the desired formed  polymer  particles as  the  first prod uct. Eventually, a  fluidized bed  of  the  desired  polymer particles supplants  the  start-up bed.</p>
<p>In  order  to  achieve  the  desired density ranges  in th copolymers  it is necessary to copolymerize enough of the 2C3  comonomers  with  ethylene  to  achieve  a  level of &gt;0  to 10 mol  percent  of  the C3  to  C8  comonomer  in  20  to  and  through  the  bed,  typically in the  order  of  about the copolymer.  The  amount  of  comonomer  needed  to achieve  this  result  will  depend  on  the  particular comonomer(s)  employed.</p>
<p>The  partially  or  completely  activated  catalyst  used  in the fluidized bed is preferably stored for service in a reservoir 32  under  a  blanket of  a  gas which  is inert to the  stored material, such  as nitrogen or  argon.</p>

In  other  words, a relatively small concentration of 1-hexene monomer in the gas phase reactor can lead to a relatively large  30  drawn. The  composition of  the make-up gas is deter incorporation of 1-hexene into the polymer. Thus, 1 hexene can be incorporated into an ethylene polymer chain  in  a  gas  phase  reactor  in  amounts  up  to  20  percent by weight, preferably 5 to 11 percent by weight, to produce  linear low  density, polyethylene  having  a  den  35  state gaseous  composition  within  the  reaction  zone. sity of  less than  0.930  g/cc.

This  preferred  process  is  most useful  when olymers  having  a  density  of  0.920  g/cc  are p required.  However,  when  higher  densities  are  desired,  it  45  entrained particles are given an opportunity to drop is  possible  to  employ  catalysts  in  which  the  only  magne sium  present  is reacted  with  the  carrier (i.e. in the  sub stantial  absence  of precipitated  magnesium), and/or where  the  titanium compound  is reacted with the sup ported magnesium  composition  in  a  molar  ratio of  one  50  move  small particles at high  gas  flow rates to prevent or  less with  the  magnesium. Make-up  gas is fed to the  bed  at a rate equal to the rate at which particulate  polymer product is  with mined by  a gas  analyzer 16  positioned above the  bed. The  gas  analyzer  determines  the  composition  of  the  gas being recycled  and  the  composition  of  the  make-up  gas is  adjusted  accordingly  to  maintain  an  essentially  steady : To  insure  complete  fluidization, the recycle  gas  and, where  desired,  part  of  the  make-up  gas  are  returned to the  reactor  at  point  18  below  the  bed.  There  exists  a  gas distribution plate 20 above the point of  return to aid fluidizing  in the  bed. The  portion  of  the  gas  stream  which  does  not  reactin the bed constitutes the recycle gas which is removed from  the  polymerization zone, preferably  by  passing  it into a  velocity reduction  zone  14  above  the  bed  where back  into the bed. Particle return may  be aided by  a cyclone  22  which  may  be  part  of he  velocity  reduction t zone  or  exterior  thereto.  Where esired,  the  recycle  gas d may  then be  passed  through a filter 24  designed  to re dust from contacting heat transfer surfaces and com pressor  blades.</p>
<p>Fluidization  is  achieved  by  a  high  rate of  gas  recycle 50  times  the rate  of  feed of  make-up  gas. The  fluidized bed  has  the  general  appearance  of  a  dense  mass  of  viable particles  in possible free-vortex flow  as created  by  the percolation of  gas  through  the  bed.  The  pressure drop mass  of  the  bed  divided  by  the  cross-sectional  area. It  is thus  dependent  on  the geometry  of  the reactor.</p>
<p>A  fluidized  bed  reaction  system  which  can  be  used  in the practice of  the process of  the present invention is illustrated in FIG.  1.  With  reference  thereto  the  reactor 10  consists of  a reaction zone  12  and  a  velocity reduc  55  wherein it is stripped of  heat of  reaction before it is tion zone  14. The reaction zone 12 comprises a bed of  growing polymer particles,  formed polymer particles  and a minor  amount  of  catalyst  particles  fluidized  by  the  con tinuous flow of  polymerizable and modifying gaseous components in the form of  make-up feed and recycle gas through the reaction zone. To maintain a viable fluidized bed, the mass  gas flow rate through the bed must  be  above  the  minimum  flow  required  for  fluidiza tion, and  preferably from about 1.5 to about 10  times  65  it conform  to the  temperature  of  the remainder  of  the Gmrand  more  preferably  from  about  3  to  about  6  times Gnf:Gmfis used in the  accepted  form  as the abbrevia tion  for  the  minimum  mass  gas  flow  required  to  achieve The  recycle  gas  is then  compressed  in  a  compressor 25 and then passed through  a heat  exchanger 26 returned to the bed. By  constantly removing heat of reaction, no  noticeable  temperature  gradient  appears  to exist  within  the  upper  portion  of he  bed.  A  emperature t t gradient  will exist  in  the  bottom  of he  bed  in  a  layer  of t about 6  to 12 inches, between the temperature of  the inlet gas  and the temperature of  the remainder of  the bed. Thus, it  has been observed that the bed acts to almost  immediately  adjust  the  temperature  of  the  recy cle  gas  above  this  bottom  layer  of  the  bed  zone  to  make bed  thereby  maintaining  itself  at  an  essentially  constant temperature  under  steady  state conditions.  The  recycle is then returned to the reactor  at  its base  18  and  to the</p>

<p>0.94, and  temperatures of  about  90 to 115  C.  are  used to  prepare  products  having  a  density  of  about &gt;0.94  to 0.96.</p>
<p>20 aids  in distributing  the  catalyst  throughout  the  bed  and The partially or completely activated catalyst in jected  into  the  bed  at  a  rate  equal  to  its consumption  at a  point  30  which  is above  the  distribution plate  20. In jecting the catalyst at a point above the distribution plate  is  an  important  feature  of  this  invention. Since  the catalysts  used  in  the  practice  of  this  invention  are  highly active, injection of  the  fully  activated catalyst into the area  below  the  distribution  plate  may ause  polymeriza c tion  to  begin  there  and  eventually  cause  plugging  of he t distribution  plate. Injection  into the  viable  bed,  instead, tends to preclude the formation of  localized spots of high catalyst concentration which may result in the formation of  "hot  spots".</p>
<p>The  fluid  bed  reactor  is  operated  at  pressures  of  p  to u about 1000  psi, and  is preferably  operated  at  a  pressure of from about 150 to 350 psi,  with operation at the higher pressures in such ranges favoring heat transfer since an increase in pressure  increases the unit volume heat  capacity  of  the  gas.</p>
<p>Hydrogen  may  be  used  as  a  chain  transfer  agent  in  the  25 polymerization reaction of  the present invention. The ratio  of hydrogen/ethylene employed will  vary be tween  about  0  to about  2.0  moles  of ydrogen  per  mole h of  the  monomer  in the  gas  stream.</p>
<p>The  distribution plate 20  plays an important role in the  operation  of  the  reactor.  The  fluidized bed  contains growing and formed particulate polymer particles as well as catalyst particles. As  the polymer  particles are hot and  possibly active, they must  be  prevented from settling, for  if  a  quiescent  mass  is allowed  to  exist, any active  catalyst contained  therein may  continue  to react  10 and  cause  fusion. Diffusing  recycle  gas  through  the  bed at  a  rate  sufficient  to  maintain  fluidization  at  the  base  of the bed is, therefore, important. The  distribution plate 20 serves this purpose and may be a screen, slotted plate, perforated plate, a  plate of  the  bubble  cap  type,  15 and  the like. The  elements of  the plate may  all be  sta tionary,  or  the  plate  may e  of he  mobile  type  disclosed b t in U.S. Pat. No.  3,298,792. Whatever  its design, it must diffuse  the  recycle  gas  through  the  particles  at the  base of  the  bed  to  keep  them  in  a  fluidized  condition,  and  also serve  to  support  a  quiescent  bed  of  resin  particles  when the reactor  is not  in operation. The  mobile  elements  of the  plate  may  be  used  to  dislodge  any  polymer  particles entrapped in or on  the plate.</p>
<p>30 rate of  catalyst injection. The  production rate may  be The  production rate of  the  bed  is controlled by  the increased  by  simply  increasing  the  rate  of atalyst  injec c tion and  decreased by  reducing  the rate of  catalyst in jection.</p>
<p>A  gas  which  is inert  to  the  catalyst  such  as nitrogen or argon is used to carry the partially or completely reduced precursor composition,  and any additional activator  compound or  non-gaseous  chain  transfer agent that is needed, into the  bed.</p>
<p>Any  gas  inert  to  the  catalyst  and  reactants  can  also  be present in the gas stream. The  activator compound  is preferably added to the reaction system at the hottest portion of  the gas which is usually downstream from heat exchanger  26. Thus, the  activator  may  be  fed  into the  gas  recycle  system  from  dispenser  27  thru  line  27A.</p>

This insures the maintenance of  an essen tially constant  temperature  in  the  bed.  Complete  instru cooling system is,  of  course, necessary to detect any temperature  change  in  the  bed  so  as  to  enable  the  opera the recycle  gas. . . . "</p>
<p>The  particulate  polymer  product  is  preferably  contin uously  withdrawn  at  a  point  34  at  or  close  to  the  distri bution plate  20  and  in suspension  with  a  portion of  the gas  stream  which  is vented  before  the  particulates  settle to preclude further polymerization and  sintering when the particles reach their ultimate collection zone. The suspending gas may  also be used, as mentioned  above, to drive  the  product  of  one  reactor  to  another  reactor.</p>
<p>Compounds  of  the structure  Zn(Ra)(R),  wherein Ra and Rb  are  the  same  or different C  to C14  aliphatic or aromatic  hydrocarbon  radicals,  may  be  used  in  conjunc tion with hydrogen, with the catalysts of  the present invention  as  molecular  weight  control or  chain  transfer agents, that  is, to  increase  the  melt  index  values  of  the copolymers  that  are  produced.  About  0  to  50,  and  pref. erably  about  20  to  30,  mols  of he  Zn  compound  (as  Zn) t would  be  used  in the  gas  stream  in the  reactor  per  mol of  titanium compound  (as Ti)  in the reactor. The  zinc compound  would  be  introduced  into  the  reactor  prefer ably in the form of  a dilute solution (2 to 30 weight percent)  in  hydrocarbon  solvent  or  absorbed  on  a  solid diluent material, such as silica, of  the types described above, in amounts of  about 10 to 50 weight percent.  50 related to product formation, a measurement of the These compositions tend to be pyrophoric. The  zinc compound maybe  added  alone, or with  any  additional portions  of  the  activator  compound  that  are  to  be  added to  the  reactor  from  a  feeder,  not  shown,  which  could  be positioned adjacent dispenser 27, near the hottest por  55 tion of  the  gas recycle  system. 45 Under  a  given  set of  operating  conditions, the  fluid ized  bed  is maintained  at  essentially  a  constant  height  by withdrawing  a  portion of  the  bed  as  product  at a rate equal  to  the  rate  of ormation  of  the  particulate  polymer f product. Since the rate of  heat generation is directly temperature  rise  of  the  gas  across  the  reactor  (the  differ ence  between  inlet  gas  temperature  and  exit  gas  temper ature)  is determinative  of he  rate  of  particulate  polymer t formation  at  a  constant  gas  velocity.</p>

While valve 38 is closed, valve 36 is opened  to  emit  a  plug  of  gas  and  product  to  the  zone  40 between  it and  valve  36  which  is then  closed.  Valve  38</p>
<p>It is essential to operate the fluid bed reactor at a temperature below the sintering temperature of the polymer  particles. To  insure that sintering will not  oc cur,  operating  temperatures  below  the  sintering  temper ature are desired. For the production of  ethylene co polymers in the process of the present invention an operating temperature of  about 30' to 115  C. is pre ferred,  and  a  temperature  of  about  75" to  95°C.  is most preferred.  Temperatures  of  about  75° to  90° C.  are  used to prepare products having  a density of  about 0.91 to 0.92, and  temperatures  of  about  80' to 100° C. are  used to  prepare  products  having  a  density  of bout &gt;0.92  to a</p>

<p>capable of producing low density.  ethylene/hexene copolymers in a gas phase, fluid bed reactor, which copolymers  are  capable  of  being  formed  into  films  hav ing especially desirable properties. More  particularly, these catalysts are  prepared by  heating  silica at a  tem  25.  silica  is believed to contain about 3 mmoles of OH perature  of  at least 600  C., e.g., from  about  750° C.  to about  850  C., for  a  period  of  time  sufficient to remove physically and  chemically  bound  water on  the  silica to the extent that from  about  0.3 to about  0.7 mmoles  of OH  groups  are present  per  gram  of  silica. This  silica is  30 then slurried in a liquid medium and contacted with from  about 1.1 to  about  2.5 mmoles  of  a Grignard  rea gent in this liquid medium  for a  time  and  temperature sufficient  to  permit  dissolved  organomagnesium  to  react with  reactive  OH roups  on  the  silica.  The  liquid  is  then  35 g evaporated,  and  the resulting dry,  free-flowing  powder is  slurried in another liquid medium to be contacted with a tetravalent titanium compound,  the number  of moles of  this tetravalent titanium compound  being in excess  of  the  number  of  moles  of  magnesium  supported  40 on  the  silica. For  example,  this molar  ratio  of  tetravalent titanium to  supported  magnesium  may  be  from  about  3 to about  6. Davison silica gel, Grade 952, was dehydrated by fluidizing with nitrogen, heating at 200  C. for two hours and cooling to room temperature. This heated groups  per  gram  of  silica. 15g  of  this product  was  slurried  in  200  ml  n-hexane. A  2.0 molar solution of ethylmagnesium chloride in tetrahydrofuran (50 ml, 100 mmoles)  was  added drop wise  to  the  refluxing  slurry  over  approximately  20  min utes, after which time refluxing was continued for a further 30  minutes.

<p>Catalysts were initially  tested in a 1.6 liter slurry Analysis of  the solid would typically show  the fol-  50  cient triethyl aluminum to give an Al/Tiratio of  40. lowing  percent  by  weight:  Mg:  6.1 percent,  Ti: 4.9  per cent;  which  corresponds  to  TiMg2.45Cl39(THF)70. THF  means  tetrahydrofuran. hexane  and  about 100 ml  of  1-hexene (62.5gms)  were added to the autoclave while at ambient temperature. 0.047 gms  of  catalyst (0.06 mmols  of  Ti) was  slurried into about 50 ml of  hexane  to which  was  added suffi This  catalyst  slurry  was  transferred  to  the reactor  using slight nitrogen pressure and 0.03  moles of hydrogen were added by measuring through a calibrated Hoke bomb.</p>
<h2>EXAMPLES  2-7</h2>
<p>The  stirring rate was adjusted to 1000 rpm  and the temperature  control  unit  set  to  80° C.  Ethylene  pressure was  introduced  when  the  autoclave  reached  40 C.,  and the total reactor  pressure was  adjusted to 115  psi.</p>
<p>The  catalysts of  Examples  2-7  were  prepared  in two 60  order  to  produce 130-150  grams  of  polymer. steps  and  the  details  are  summarized  in Table  I, herein below.  The  preparation of  the  catalyst of  Example  2  is felt to be representative of  the  preparation of  the  cata lysts of  Examples  3-7  and  is described below:</p>

<p>If  silica dried  at  800  C,  is used  in  place  of ilica  dried s at  200 C.,  the  copolymerization  properties  of  the  cata lysts may  vary. It is noted that silica dried at 200  C. contains about 6 SiOH groups/100 Angstrom? while silica  dried at 800°  C. contains only about 1  SiOH group/100  Angstrom.</p>
<p>Ethylene/1-butene  copolymers  were  prepared  under similar  conditions  with  both  comparative  A  atalyst  and c the Example  2  catalyst. Table II summarizes  the  poly merization conditions  and  product  properties  of  C2/C4 copolymers  prepared  with A nd Example  2  catalysts. a Examination  of  the  data  in  Table  II  indicates  that  under similar polymerization conditions the Example  2 cata lyst  produced  a  lower  density  product  than  the  A ata c lyst.</p>

This  extra heat could result in se vere temperature gradients within certain fluid bed reactors  and poor operability  and/or bulk density. Therefore, even in gas phase, fluidized bed arrange ments  which  cannot  optimally  accommodate  relatively high heat generating catalysts, such  as  the Example  2 catalyst, such  fluidizing  bed  arrangements  may  readily accommodate relatively low  heat  generating  catalysts, such  as  the Example  6  catalyst, without  encountering problems  of  severe  temperature  gradients, poor  opera bility  and/or  poor  bulk  density.</p>
