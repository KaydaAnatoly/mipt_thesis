<h2>ZEGLER-NATTA  CATALYST  AND  METHOD  FOR MAKING  AND  USING  SAME</h2>
<h2>FIELD OF  THE  INVENTION</h2>
<p>0001. The  present  invention relates to catalysts, and  par ticularly  to  Ziegler-Natta catalysts and to  a  method for making  and using  catalysts in polymerization reactions.</p>
<h2>BACKGROUND  OF  THE  INVENTION</h2>
<p>0002 Ziegler-Natta catalysts are advantageously used  in olefin polymerization reactions to produce Stereoregulated linear  polymers.  It  is  known  that  Ziegler-Natta  catalysts  may be  formed by coating  a  Silica  Support  material  with  a magnesium-halide  compound,  a transition metal  compound, electron  donor  compound(s)  and  an  organo-aluminum cocatalyst. The  transition metal is an active catalytic ingre dient and the  magnesium-halide compound may also be thought of as being active  to the extent that it  acts as a Synergist  to increase the overall  catalytic productivity of  the transition metal.  The  electron  donor  compounds  and  organo aluminum  cocatalyst are important  because they enable the Ziegler-Natta  catalyst  to  catalyze  polymerization  of  isotactic polymers.  The Silica  material  is  inactive  and  does  not increase polymerization reaction rates.</p>
<p>0003. It  is  known  that  silica-based  Ziegler-Natta  catalysts may  be produced from high-porosity Silica particles in the diameter range of about 10-100 microns, which may be coated  with  1 or  more  relatively thin layers  of  a  magnesium halide compound  to form  a catalyst Support, which may  be treated with a transition metal  to form  a  catalyst. However, this type of catalyst generally comprises a high ratio  of inactive Silica relative to the active ingredients. Further, the catalyst Supports may need to be mechanically treated to produce  generally  Spherical, or  spheroidal,  catalyst  Supports of  the appropriate diameter and particle diameter distribu tion, which will form catalyst particles of the appropriate diameter and particle diameter distribution and, thus, will facilitate efficient polymerization reactions.</p>
<p>0004 U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,293,673 and 4,376,062, both to Hamer et al.,  disclose  methods for forming Silica based catalysts with  very  Small  Silica  particles,  no  larger  than  about 0.05 micron, which are  mixed in a slurry to  form solid agglomerations comprising a  number of Silica  particles mixed with active ingredients. While Hamer  utilizes silica particles which are very Small, the resulting catalysts Still comprise at  least  10 wt %  inert silica  material. This is undesirable because the higher the relative amount of  inert Silica material the lower  the Overall activity of  the catalyst, and  the higher  the amount  of  catalyst residues in a polymer formed  therewith.  Thus,  the  production  costs  of  the  polymer, per  weight  unit  of  catalyst, is higher  for  catalysts  containing relatively large amounts of inert material. Further, higher amounts  of  catalyst residues may  detrimentally affect  poly mer processing and/or the physical properties of  products made with the polymer.</p>
<p>0005 Thus, there is a need for an efficient and reliable method for producing catalyst Support materials, and ulti mately catalysts, which  comprise  a  relatively Small  percent age  of inactive  materials,  and which have  a  relatively Smooth spherical or spheroidal shape and Suitable average particle diameter and  particle diameter distribution.</p>
<h2>SUMMARY  OF  THE  INVENTION</h2>
<p>0006 The invention comprises a  method for  making magnesium-halide Supports of a Specified particle shape, average diameter and particle diameter distribution, which comprises providing a non-aqueous Solution of a magne sium-halide  containing  Silica particles  dispersed  therein,  and crystallizing  the magnesium-halide  about  the Silica particles to provide the magnesium-halide Support, wherein the Sup port  has an  approximately  spherical  shape,  an  average particle diameter from about 10  to about 120  microns,  and a particle diameter distribution from about 10  to about 150 microns.  The  invention further comprises  methods  for mak ing catalysts and using Same in polymerization reactions. The invention further  comprises  catalyst Supports and  cata lysts.</p>
<p>0007 Catalysts of the invention may include transition metal compounds,  organo-aluminum  co-catalysts  and/or electron  donors  and  may  be  useful  for  the  polymerization  of olefins to provide polymers having good morphology and bulk density.</p>

<h2>DETAILED  DESCRIPTION  OF  PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</h2>
<p>0011. The present invention generally concerns Ziegler Natta catalysts and  processes for making and using Same, which may include coating a Silica Support material, acting as a Seeding  agent, with a magnesium  compound  to form a Solid catalyst Support. The  catalyst Support may  be reacted with  a  transition  metal,  an  internal  electron  donor,  an organo-aluminum  co-catalyst and  an  external  electron  donor to form a catalyst Suitable for, for example, various poly merization reactions.</p>
<p>0012. In a preferred process, a Silica Seeding agent is dispersed  in  a  non-polar,  non-ionic  oil, for  example,  mineral oil, paraffin oil or  Silicone oil, in a  mixing  apparatus  Such  as a simple paddle Stirrer operating at a few  hundred rpms  or a Ultra-Turrax(RT  50  Homogenizer  with stirring speeds  up to 10,000  rpms. Preferably, the ratio of  silica seeding  agent to oil is in the range of  about 0.25 grams  per liter to about 25.0  grams  per  liter, more  preferably  about  1.0  gram  per  liter to about 10.0 grams per liter. The Silica Seeding agent is described in more detail below.</p>
<p>0013 Anhydrous magnesium halide compound can be added  to the dispersion of  silica in oil, followed  by  addition of  an  alkanol  Solvent  Such as  anhydrous  ethanol, methanol, or  2-ethyl-1-hexanol.  Alternatively, anhydrous  ethanol, methanol  or  2-ethyl-1-hexanol  can  be  added  to  an  anhydrous (i.e.,  less  than about 0.5  wt %  HO)  magnesium-halide compound  to form a Soluble complex, as described below. About  0.01 wt  %  o about 10.0  wt  %,  more  preferably  from t about  0.1 wt  % o about  5.0  wt  %,  and  still more  preferably t</p>
<p>from  about  0.5 wt  % o about  3.0  wt  % f  the silica seeding t o agent is used relative to the magnesium-halide compound. Generally,  a higher  ratio  of magnesium-halide to  Silica Seeding agent in  the  mixture results in a higher ratio  of magnesium-halide to Silica in the catalyst Support formed and, consequently, a larger catalyst Support is expected to form because more magnesium-halide crystalizes onto the Silica Seeding  agent.</p>
<p>0.014. The  solvent  is  added  in amounts  from  about  2  to  20 times,  preferably  about 6 times, the  molar ratio  of the magnesium-halide compound  to facilitate the liquefying of the  magnesium-halide compound at a lower temperature. U.S. Pat.  No. 4,421,674 to Invernizzi et  al.  teaches, for example, that when  the mole ratio of  ethanol ('EtOH') to MgCl,  is 102,  the  complex  liquefies  at  60°  C.;  at  a  mole  ratio of EtOH  to MgCl2 of  7.75 the complex  liquefies at 80° C.; at a mole ratio  of EtOH to MgCl, of 6.51 the complex liquefies at 90° C.; and  at  a mole  ratio of  EtOH  to MgCl, of 5.43  the  complex  liquefies  at 100° C.  The  mixture  is initially translucent due to the Suspension of  the magnesium-halide compound and the  Silica  Seeding agent. The mixture is heated  to  about  60°  C.  to about  140°C.,  preferably  about  80° C. to about  120° C.,  until  the  solvent  begins  to reflux  and  the magnesium-halide  compound  goes  into  Solution,  whereupon the  mixture becomes transparent,  and the  temperature is maintained  at the reflux temperature for about  0.25  hours  to about 3.0 hours, preferably about 1.0 hour to  about 2.0 hours, preferably with continuous stirring. It is possible to form the mixture without  either the oil or  the Solvent,  or  by mixing the ingredients in a different order, but the above described mixing operation has been shown to result in a well-dispersed mixture.</p>
<p>0015 The  clear  mixture,  which  includes  a  MgCl2.xEtOH complex (where  X is  an integer from  1-20),  is  rapidly transferred to a Second mixing  apparatus containing a pre chilled  hydrocarbon  Solvent,  Such  as  heptane,  hexane,  cyclo hexane, or other aliphatic  or cycloaliphatic  hydrocarbon which  is miscible in the oil and  which  will not  freeze at the temperatures necessary for the Solidification of  the MgCl2.xEtOH complex. The hydrocarbon solvent is pre chilled, for example, to between ice (0° C.) and dry ice/ isopropanol temperatures (i.e., about -70° C. to -90° C.). The rapid temperature decrease causes almost all of the magnesium-halide compound  to precipitate out of  Solution and  crystallize onto  the Silica  Seeding  agent,  thus  coating  the Silica Seeding  agent  to form  a  catalyst  Support. The  catalyst Support  particles  preferably include less  than  10  wt  %  ilica, S preferably no more  than 5  wt  %  ilica, and  more  preferably s no more than 3  wt  % ilica. S</p>
<p>0016. After  about  0.5 to 2  hours,  preferably  about  1 hour, the mixture is allowed to warm  to room  temperature and  it is filtered. Approximately Spherical and/or  Spheroidal Solid catalyst  Support  particles,  each  comprising  at  least one  Silica Seeding  agent  with  magnesium-halide  crystals  attached thereto, are collected and  washed Several times with more hydrocarbon  Solvent, until the hydrocarbon  Solvent appears to  be  colorless,  and  are dried  (e.g., vacuum  dried)  in a  rotary evaporator  at  about  40 C.  to 80 C.,  preferably at about  60 C., for 1 to 3  hours,  preferably for about  2  hours. The  term 'approximately Spherical'  or 'approximately Spheroidal' means  that  all  points  on  the  Surface  of  the  particle are within the range of  radius r to 2r wherein r is the minimum  radial distance between the center of  the particle and  the closest point  thereto  on  the Surface of  the particle. The  magnesium halide compound may alternately be crystallized onto the Silica Seeding  agent  with known  Spray drying  techniqueS  or by  gradually evaporating the Solvent in which  it was  origi nally dissolved.</p>
<p>0017 Next,  the  catalyst  support  is slowly  added  to about 10  to  50  moles  of  a  transition metal  compound  for  each  mole of  magnesium  in the magnesium-halide compound  at about -30  to 50  C., and  the temperature of  this mixture is raised to about  20  to  80°C.,  preferably  about  30-60°  C.  An nternal i electron  donor is  added and the  temperature  is  raised, generally with stirring, to about 80  to 130  C., preferably 100-110° C., and  is kept  at that level for about 1 to 3  hours, preferably about 2  hours.</p>
<p>0018. The internal electron donor  compound,  in general, is used in an amount  from about 0.05 to about 2.0 moles, preferably about 0.1 to about 0.5 mole, for each mole of magnesium in the magnesium-halide compound.</p>
<p>0019. The result is a mixture comprising solid catalyst particles  and  unreacted  transition metal  compound  and  inter nal electron donor  compound.</p>
<p>0020. The solid catalyst particles are  filtered  out and, preferably,  extracted  for  about  1 to  3  hours,  preferably  about 2  hours,  at  about  110  to 140  C.,  more  preferably  about  125 C. with a mixture of  transition metal  compound  (about  5  to 30 wt %,  preferably about 10  wt %), and an inert solvent, Such as a  C-C alkylbenzene, preferably ethylbenzene (about 70  to 85  wt  %,  preferably  about  90  wt  %)  in a  known 'Soxhlet'  extraction  type  arrangement.  This  extraction  treat ment  enhances  catalyst activity and  Stereospecificity. Alter natively, the Solid catalyst may  receive any number  of  other known extraction  treatments,  which may, but need not, include a transition metal  treatment.  Alternatively, the cata lyst  could simply be boiled in  a Solution comprising a transition metal  compound  with or without  an  inert Solvent, i.e., a  Solvent  which  will not  react with the transition metal compound. U.S. Pat. No. 4,745,164 to Schweier  et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 6,034,023 to Kersting  et al., which  are incor porated by reference herein, teach examples of extraction methods which may  be utilized in the present invention.</p>
<p>0021. The Solid catalyst may  be recovered by filtration, washed with an inert Solvent, Such as heptane, hexane, cyclohexane or other aliphatic or cycloaliphatic hydrocar bon, dried by draining off transition metal compound and Solvent, washed a Second time with the inert Solvent, and dried.</p>
<p>0022. The  solid  catalyst Support  particles and/or  catalyst particles  preferably  comprise  about  0.01  wt  %  o  about  10  wt t %  silica, more  preferably about 0.1 wt  %  to about 5 wt  % Silica.</p>
<p>0023 The  solid  catalyst Support  particles and/or  catalyst particles preferably have a weight percent ratio of  Silica to magnesium-halide compound  in the range of  about 1:20 to 1:3, preferably from about 1:10 to 1:4.</p>
<p>0024. The catalyst may preferably be treated with an organo-aluminum  co-catalyst and  an  external  electron  donor or other  Stereoregulating agent to  form  a Ziegler-Natta catalyst,  which  may  be  used, for  example,  in  polymerization reactions. Examples  of  external electron donor  compounds which may  be used in the catalytic System of  the invention</p>
<p>include  mono- and polyfunctional carboxylic acids,  car boxylic  anhydrides  and carboxylic  esters,  and ketones, ethers, alcohols, lactones  as  well  as organic  phosphorus  and Silicon compounds.  Also, a  mixture of  two  or more  external electron donor  compounds  can  be used. The  external elec tron donor  compound  and the internal electron donor  com pound  used in the preparation of  the Solid catalyst compo nent  may be  the  same  or  different.  Preferred  external electron donor  compounds  are disclosed below.</p>
<p>0.025 In  such  cases  the  organo-aluminum  co-catalyst  and the external  electron donor  may  be  contacted with  the Solid catalyst Separately, in any  order, or  together, preferably at a temperature from  about  0  to 200 C., more  preferably from about  20  to 90° C., and  preferably at a pressure of  about 1 to 100  bar, more  preferably from about 1 to 40  bar.</p>
<p>0.026 Preferably,  the  organo-aluminum  co-catalyst  is added in Such an amount  that the molar  ratio of  the alumi num  co-catalyst to the transition metal in the Solid catalyst is  from about 10:1 to about 800:1, more preferably from about 20:1 to about 200:1.</p>
<p>0027. The external electron donor is used  with the cata lyst in amounts ranging  from  about 1 to 100  moles,  prefer ably 10  to 30  moles,  for  each  mole  of  transition metal  in the catalyst.  Generally, it  is highly preferred that an external electron donor, with or without the organo-aluminum co catalyst,  be  used in  order  to  maintain  a  high  level  of Stereospecificity in polymers  produced  with  the catalysts of the invention.</p>
<p>0028. A  preferred  silica seeding  agent  is a microspheroi dal  silica  (SiO2),  for  example,  a  fumed Silica  Such  as CAB-O-SIL(R-5  (Cabot  Corporation;  Midland,  Mich.). Other  Silica Seeding  agents  may  include,  for  example,  Aero sile)  fumed silica, available from USA  Midwest Degussa Corporation,  3500  Embassy Parkway  Ste. 100,  Akron  Ohio 4.4333.</p>
<p>0029. The silica  seeding agent is  characterized by its relatively Small average particle  diameter, i.e.,  preferably about 0.005-10 microns, more preferably about 0.001-5.0 microns, most  preferably from about  0.01 microns  to about 1.0  micron. The Silica  Seeding agent  has  low porosity because of  its lack of, or  Small  quantity of, pores.  That  is, it has  a porosity  of  less  than  about  0.5  cc/gram  as  measured  by nitrogen adsorption, which  indicates that the Silica particles have relatively Smooth Surfaces. The Silica Seeding agent particles have relatively  uniform spherical or spheroidal shape, i.e.,  approximately Spherical shape, and preferably having  a  radius  which  does  not  vary  by  more  than  about  20% from the center to any point on the Surface of the particle. The particles of the Silica Seeding agent have a relatively small particle diameter distribution, such that 50%  of the Silica particles have particle diameters ranging from about 0.05 microns to about 0.5 microns.</p>
<p>0030 The small particle diameter of the silica seeding agent is significant because the resulting catalyst will ulti mately  comprise  a relatively Small  percentage,  i.e., less  than 10 wt %, of inert silica material as compared to the total weight  of  the  catalyst  Support.  Thus,  the  catalyst  will  operate more efficiently because a relatively larger portion of the Solid  catalyst  will  comprise  active  catalytic material,  i.e., the transition  metal and the  magnesium-halide Synergist.  In preferred  catalyst Supports  the Silica component  will  be  leSS</p>
<p>than 10 wt %  of the total catalyst Support weight, more preferably about 0.1 wt %  to about 5 wt  %,  and yet more preferably about  0.5 wt  % o about  3.0  wt  % f  the catalyst t o Support  formed  by  the above-described  processes. Since the Silica  Seeding agent provides a Surface  upon which the magnesium-halide compound will crystallize, the Smooth approximately spherical shape and Small particle diameter distribution of  the  Silica  Seeding  agent will result in catalyst Support particles, and ultimately catalyst particles, with a relatively Smooth approximately spherical shape and  Small particle  diameter  distribution.  These  qualities  will  contribute to an  efficient  polymerization  process  with  a  relatively Small amount of fines in polymers produced in  reactions con ducted  with the catalysts of  the invention. This  is an  advan tage over other catalysts which, for example, may need to undergo various complex  and  expensive processes in order to acquire an approximately Spherical shape and/or accept able particle diameter and  particle diameter distribution.</p>
<p>0031. The  diameters  of  the catalyst  support  particles will range  from about 5-150 microns, more preferably  from about 20-60 microns, most preferably from about 20-40 microns.  The  particle  size distribution of  the  catalyst  Support particles is Such that 50%  of  the catalyst Support particles have particle diameters ranging from about 20 microns to about 60  microns.</p>
<p>0032. The catalyst particles will have diameters which are about  20%-50%  smaller. For  example,  a  support  particle with a 70  micron diameter may  result in a catalyst particle with  a  50-60  micron  diameter.  The  reason  for  this reduction in  Size  is  as follows.  It  is  generally known that ethanol dissolves the MgCl2 by first Swelling the structure of the solid MgCl.  (MgCl2  has  a  layered  structure. Ethanol  occu pies the interstitial spaces between the MgCl2 layers.) AS more alcohol is added and/or the material is heated, this Structure continues  to Swell  or  expand  until  the  MgCl, layers Segregate and  the MgCloEtOH  complex  becomes  a liquid. When  this complex is reacted with TiCl, the removal of ethanol  causes  the  Structure and  thus  the  particle to  Shrink  or diminish in size. Thus,  the catalyst Supports  and  catalysts of the invention  are notable  for  having  relatively thick  layers  of active ingredients, referring to both the Synergistic magne sium-halide layer and  active transition metal  layer, on  rela tively Small  Silica particles.  Again,  this results  in the overall percentage of inactive Silica delivered to a polymerization reactor to be lower than in other known  processes. Conse quently, overall  efficiency in the polymerization reactor will be higher.</p>
<p>0033 Preferably, catalyst Support particles and catalyst particles of  the invention will each include one Silica Seed particle, or  a  Small  group  of  Silica Seed  particles  comprising less  than  10%  of  the  total  catalyst  Support  weight.  In  contrast to  the  present invention,  other known catalysts typically comprise relatively large Silica particles or agglomerations of a  number of very  Small Silica  particles  within  each catalyst Support  particle Such  that there is a  relatively larger amount  (e.g., up to 50  wt  %)  of inert Silica in the catalyst particle.</p>
<p>0034. The magnesium compound is an inorganic solid magnesium-halide compound  containing at least one halo gen  atom,  Such  as  magnesium  chloride, magnesium  bromide and magnesium iodide, as well  as mixed  halogen oxides or hydroxides  like chloromagnesium  hydroxide,  bromomagne</p>
<p>sium hydroxide  and iodomagnesium hydroxide. Among these compounds  the magnesium  dihalides  corresponding  to the formula MgX are preferred wherein X  is a halogen. Especially preferred is magnesium  chloride (MgCl). Pref erably, the inorganic Solid magnesium-halide compound  is in a Substantially anhydrous  condition.</p>
<p>0.035 Transition metal compounds  for treating the cata lyst  Support are  preferably  titanium  or  Vanadium com pounds. Titanium compounds useful in preparing the Solid catalyst component include the halogenides of tri- or tet ravalent titanium. Titanium alkoxy halogenide compounds and mixtures of  two  or more titanium compounds  are also contemplated.  Examples of Suitable  titanium compounds include TiBr, TiBri, TiCl, TiCl, Ti(OCH)Cl. Ti(OCH3)Cls, Ti(O-iso-CH2)C1, Ti(O-n-CHg)Cls, Ti(OCH)Br, Ti(O-n-CH-)Br, Ti(OCH)  Cl, Ti(OCH3)Cl., Ti(O-n-CH3)2Cl2, Ti(OCH3)Br, Ti(OCH)  Cl, Ti(OCH) Cl, Ti(O-n-CHo).  Cl, Ti(OCH),  Br, Ti(OCH),  Ti(OCH),  or  Ti(O-n-CHo). Preferred titanium compounds include those wherein the halogen is chlorine.  Also  preferred are those titanium halo genides  that  in  addition  to  the  titanium  contain  only  halogen, and  of  these  the  titanium  chlorides,  and  in  particular  titanium tetrachloride, are preferred.</p>
<p>0.036 Vanadium  compounds  useful in the preparation of the  Solid  catalytic  component  of  the  catalytic  System described herein  include  the  Vanadium  halogenides,  the Vanadium oxyhalogenides,  the  Vanadium  alkoxides  and Vanadium acetylacetonate. Preferred Vanadium  compounds are those having  oxidation Stages 3  to 5.</p>
<p>0037. The function of the internal and external electron donors, e.g., Lewis bases, is two-fold. One function is to block 'coordinately unsaturated' Sites on the magnesium compound  So that the active site, the transition metal  com pound,  will not  attach  to those Sites. The  other  function  is to reduce the 'coordinately unsaturated' environment  around the  bound  active  site in  order  to improve  its  Stereospecificity. Both results are the Same, i.e. the electron donors improve the  isotacticity  or Stereoregularity  of polymers produced with  the catalyst. The  reason  for this is that a 'coordinately unsaturated'  Site  has a lower energy barrier for binding propylene in  various configurations, i.e.,  it  can bond to propylene in multiple ways, leading to a reduction in poly mer  isotacticity and  Subsequently lower  polymer  crystallin ity.  Lower polymer crystallinity  results in lower polymer melting points  and increased  hydrocarbon (e.g.,  xylene, decalin, or heptane) Solubles. A coordinatively Saturated' ' Site will predominately bond  to the active site in only one way. As a result, a coordinatively Saturated Site produces uniform or isotactic polypropylene.</p>
<p>0.038 Internal electron donor  compounds  which may  be used in the preparation of the Solid catalytic component include, at least, mono  or polyfunctional carboxylic acids, carboxylic  anhydrides,  or  carboxylic  esters, and  also ketones,  ethers, alcohols, lactones  or  organophosphorous  or organosilicon compounds.</p>
<p>0.039 Preferred internal electron donor  compounds included  carboxylic  acid  derivatives  and,  in  particular, phthalic acid derivatives having the general formula (I):</p>
<p>(I)</p>
<figure></figure>
<p>wherein  X  and  Y ach represent  a chlorine or  bromine  atom e or a C-Co alkoxy group, or X  and Y  taken  together represent an oxygen atom forming an anhydride function. Particularly  preferred  internal  electron  donor  compounds  are phthalic esters of formula (I) wherein X  and  Y ach are a e C-Cs  alkoxy  group,  such  as  a  methoxy,  ethoxy,  n-propyloxy, isopropyloxy,  n-butyloxy,  Sec-butyloxy,  or  tert-butyloxy group. Examples  of  preferred  phthalic  esters include diethyl phthalate, di-n-butyl phthalate, di-isobutyl phthalate, di-npentyl  phthalate,  di-n-hexyl  phthalate,  di-n-heptyl  phthalate, di-n-octyl phthalate or di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate.</p>
<p>0040. Further examples of preferred  internal  electron donor compounds include diesters of 3- or 4-membered, optionally  Substituted  cycloalkane 1,2-dicarboxylic  acids,  as well  as  monoesters  of  Substituted  benzophenone  2-carboxy lic acids  or  Substituted  benzophenone  3-carboxylic  acids.  AS hydroxy  compounds  in the esterfication reaction for  synthe sis  of  these  esters, alkanols  Such  as  C-C  or  Cs-C7  cycloal kanols  (optionally  Substituted  with one  or  more  C-C alkyl groups), as well as C-Co  phenols, can be used. A articu p larly preferred  internal  electron donor  is di-alkyl  carboxylic acid ester.</p>

<p>0043.

Also,  a mixture of  two  or more  external electron donor  compounds  can  be used. The  external elec tron donor  compound  and  the internal electron donor  com pound  used in the preparation of  the Solid catalyst compo nent may  be the same  or  different. However, it is generally preferred that the internal and external electron donors be different because the desired internal electron donor  is one which will block sites that lead to 'coordinative unsatura tion'  or that transform 'coordinatively unsaturated' sites into 'coordinatively Saturated' Sites. And  yet  these internal electron donors do not react with TiCl. In the case of external electron donors, the desired molecule is one that will have the same affect on 'coordinative Saturation', but will not react with the aluminum alkyl cocatalyst. A  ol m ecule that yields 'coordinative unsaturation' yet does not react with either TiCl, and  AlR would  be ideal. However,</p>
<p>due  to the difficulty in  finding  Such  a  Single  Substance, most polypropylene  catalysts employ  two  separate  Substances  for their internal and  external electron donors.</p>
<p>0044 Preferred  external  electron donor  compounds include  the  organosilicon  compounds  of  the  general  formula (II):</p>

<p>0049 Polymerization  is initiated  by  formation  of  a  metal carbon  bond  (Ti-C).  The  function  of  the  aluminum  alkyl  is to alkylate the TiCl.  This  can  be  accomplished  in a variety of ways: by addition  of aluminum alkyl  to  the  reactor Separate  from  the  catalyst,  by  premixing  the aluminum  alkyl with the  catalyst prior to  addition to  the  reactor,  or by premixing of the  aluminum alkyl and external electron donor  prior to mixing  with the catalyst.</p>
<p>0050 Examples of Suitable  organo-aluminum co-cata lysts  include  aluminum  trialkyls  (AIR) and  derivatives thereof  wherein an alkyl group is Substituted by an alkoxy group  or  a  halogen  atom,  e.g. chlorine or  bromine  atom.

<p>0052 The catalysts of  the present invention were tested for polymerization performance using a 2-liter, jacketed, stainless  steel  reactor  available  from  Pressure  Products Industries, Inc., 900 Louis Drive, Warminster, Pa. 18974. Liquid propylene was metered in  using a high preSSure Site-glass. Hydrogen was  added  by measuring  the preSSure differential across a 300  ml  vessel.</p>
<p>0053 A  test sample of  a preferred catalyst of  the inven tion was  prepared and tested as follows:</p>
<h2>Catalyst Preparation Procedure</h2>
<p>0054) 50  milligrams of CAB-O-SIL(R) was  dispersed in about 250 ml of mineral oil in a flask by stirring. Subse quently,  10 grams of anhydrous MgCl, followed by 6 equivalents of  anhydrous  ethanol  (per  equivalent  of  magne sium)  was  added.  The  mixture was  heated until the ethanol began to reflux. The mixture was maintained at this tem perature for about 1 hour  with continuous Stirring.</p>
<p>0055. The contents of  the flask were then rapidly trans ferred to a Second flask containing 1 liter of heptane pre chilled to dry icefisopropanol temperatures. After an hour the temperature of the contents of the Second flask were allowed  to warm  to room  temperature  and  were  then  filtered. Approximately  Spherical  Solid  catalyst  Support particles were  collected  and  washed  Several times  with  heptane,  until the Washings appeared to be colorleSS, and then Vacuum dried in a rotary evaporator at 60° C. for about 2  hours.</p>
<p>0056 Next, the  solid  catalyst  Support particles  were added  slowly  to  a  third  flask  containing  200  ml  of  neat  TiCl, which had been pre-cooled to about 0° C. After the tem perature was raised to about 50-60  C., 1.5 ml of di-nbutylphthalate,  a di-alkylcarboxylic  acid  ester, as  an  internal electron donor, was added. The contents of the third flask were heated  to 100-110° C. and  held at that temperature for about  2  hours.</p>
<p>0057 The heat was  removed,  and  solid catalyst particles and liquid from the third flask were transferred to a Soxlet extractor. The liquid, which  comprised  unreacted  TiCl, and internal electron  donor  compound,  was  removed  by  filtering through a porous Sintered glass filter  that is part of the reaction vessel. The remaining  Solid catalyst particles were then  extracted  for about  two  hours  at 125  C. with  a mixture of  90%  ethylbenzene and 10%  TiCl.  This  TiCl,  treatment greatly enhances the performance of  the catalyst.</p>
<p>0.058 At  the conclusion of  the extraction, the Solid cata lyst particles were dried by draining off residual TiCland ethylbenzene, Washing with heptane, and vacuum drying. The polymerization productivity of the catalyst was then tested using  the  general  polymerization  procedure  described below.</p>
<h2>Polymerization Testing Procedure</h2>
<p>0059) A  quantity of  4  ml of 25 wt % riethylaluminum t (TEAl) was added to  a leg of a two-leg stainless Steel injector, along with 2 ml  of  a 0.1 molar Solution of  cyclo hexylmethyl  dimethoxysilane,  as  an  external  electron  donor. The aluminum alkyl activates the catalyst  by replacing  one of  the chlorides on  the titanium with  an  alkyl group. There after, alkylation can propagate continued insertion of  pro pylene groups  during  a polymerization reaction. The  exter nal  electron donor  is important  for  controlling the nature of the propylene  insertion,  but  it is not  necessary for  Starting  or maintaining propylene insertion.</p>
<p>0060 20 Milligrams of a  mixture  containing 2 parts anhydrous MgCl2 and 1 part of the experimental catalyst prepared  above  was  added  to another  leg  of  the  injector.  The experimental  catalyst was  diluted  in this manner  to  facilitate more accurate measurement  of  Small quantities of  catalyst tested in this  example.  The  injector  was  then attached to the reactor So that the contents of the injector legs could be charged to the reactor under  inert atmospheric conditions.</p>
<p>0061 A  polymerization  reaction  vessel  comprising  a  2-li ter, Stainless Steel, jacketed pressure vessel, was  purged of moisture and  oxygen  by  heating to at least 100° C. while a Slow bleed of dry  nitrogen was maintained through the vessel. The  TEAl  and  external  electron  donor  were  added  to the  reactor by flushing the  appropriate  injector  leg with 600-800  ml  of  propylene. The  catalyst was  then added  in a similar  fashion  by  flushing  the other leg  of  the injector with 200-400  ml  of  liquid  propylene.  100  delta-psig  (as  measured across  a  300  ml  vessel)  of  hydrogen  was  dded  to  the  reactor. a The vessel was  sealed and  heated  to about 70° C. Once  the temperature was  at  about  70° C.,  the  polymerization  reaction was allowed to continue for one hour. The polymerization reaction  was  then  Stopped  by  venting  the residual  propylene. The  polymerization  reaction  vessel  was  opened  and  polymer was removed.</p>
<p>0.062 Catalyst  productivity  was  measured  by  dividing  the grams of polymer produced by the  milligrams of active catalyst initially charged  to the reactor.</p>
<p>0063. The catalysts of the  invention may be advanta geously used in the polymerization of alk-1-enes. Suitable alk-1-enes include  linear or branches C-Co alkenes, in particular linear C-C  alk-1-enes  Such as ethylene,  propy lene, but-1-ene, pent-1-ene, hex-1-ene, hept-1-ene, Oct-1ene non-1-ene, dec-1-ene or 4-methylpent-1-ene.

In  these  copolymers the comonomer  content  is generally less than about  15%  by weight.  The  copolymerS  may  also  be  in  the  form  of  So-called block or impact copolymers, which comprise  at  least  a matrix of a propylene homopolymer  or propylene random copolymer  containing less than 15%  by weight  of  a further alk-1-ene having  up  to 10  carbon  atoms  and  a Soft  phase of a propylene  copolymer  containing  about 15%  to about  80% by weight of further alk-1-enes having up to 10 C-atoms. Also mixtures of comonomers  are contemplated, resulting in, e.g., terpolymers of  propylene.</p>
<p>0066. The  production of  the propylene polymers  may  be carried out  in any  common  reactor  Suitable for the polymer ization of  alk-1-enes, either batchwise or, preferably, con tinuously, i.e., in Solution (bulk  phase),  as  Suspension  poly merization or as gas phase polymerization. Examples of Suitable reactors include  continuously operated  Stirred reac tors,  loop  reactors,  fluid  bed reactors,  or  horizontal  or vertical stirred powder  bed reactors. It will be understood that the polymerization may  be carried out in a Series of consecutively coupled reactors. The reaction time depends on the chosen reaction conditions. In general the reaction time is from  about  0.2  hours  to about  10  hours,  usually  from about 0.5 hours to 5.0  hours.</p>
<p>0067. In general the polymerization is carried out at a temperature in the range of  from  about  20° C.  to about 150 C.,  preferably from  about  50° C.  to about  120° C.,  and  more preferably from  about  60° C.  to about  90°  C.,  and  a  pressure in the range  of  from  about  1 bar  to about  100  bar,  preferably from  about  15  bar  to  about  40  bar,  and  more  preferably  from about 20  bar to 35  bar.</p>
<p>0068 The  molecular  weight  of  the  so  produced  polymers may  be  controlled  and  adjusted over  a  wide  range  by  adding polymer chain transfer or termination inducing agents as commonly  used  in the art of  polymerization,  Such  as  hydro gen. In addition an  inert  Solvent,  Such  as  toluene or  hexane, or an inert gas, Such as nitrogen or argon, and Smaller amounts of  a powdered  polymer, e.g., polypropylene pow der, may  be added.</p>
<p>0069. The  weight,  i.e.,  (average  molecular  weights)  of  the propylene  polymers  produced  by  using  the catalytic System of  the invention, in general, are in the range of  from about 10,000  g/mole to 1,000,000  g/mole and the melt  flow rates are in the range of  from about 0.1 to about 100  g/10 min, preferably from about 0.5 to about 50  g/10 min. The melt flow rate corresponds  to the amount  which  is pressed  within 10  minutes from a test instrument in accordance with ISO</p>
<p>1133 at a temperature of  230  C. and  under a load of  2.06 kg. Certain applications might require different molecular weights  than  those mentioned  above  and  are  contemplated  to be included among  the polymers which are produced with the catalysts of  the invention.</p>
<p>0070 The catalytic systems of  the invention enable the polymerization of  alk-1-enes to produce polymers  having  a good morphology and  a high bulk density when  compared with  the  prior  art  catalytic  Systems.  In  addition, the catalytic Systems of  the invention have an increased productivity.</p>
<p>0071. Due  to their good  mechanical  properties the poly merS obtainable by using the Solid catalytic component of the  present  invention,  and  in  particular  the  propylene homopolymerS  or  the copolymers  of  propylene with one or more further alk-1-enes having  up  to 10  carbon atoms,  can be used advantageously for  the  production  of fibers  or moldings, and  especially for the production of  films.</p>
<p>0.072 Ziegler-Natta  catalysts  are the subject  of  continued improvements, because their properties Such as activity/ productivity,  morphology,  and  Stereospecificity  Strongly effect the polymerization process.</p>
<p>0073 While the invention has been described with ref erence to preferred embodiments, it will be understood by those  skilled  in the  art  that  various  changes  may  be  made  and equivalents may  be  substituted for  elements  thereof  without departing from the Scope of  the invention.</p>
