<h2>57 ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Polymers  of  propene  are  prepared  using  a  Ziegler-Natta catalyst system consisting of  (1) a  titanium component which contains titanium,  magnesium, chlorine and a benzenecarboxylic acid derivative on a carrier, (2) an aluminum  component  and  (3) a  silane component.  The process employs a titanium component (1) which is obtained by  a  method  in which  (1.1) first a  solid-phase intermediate is prepared from ()  magnesium  chloride, (II)  an  alkanol,  (III)  a  carrier  which  in  turn  consists  of a finely divided inorganic oxide carrier material which has been pretreated with an alkylchlorosilane,  (IV) titanium tetrachloride and (V) a phthalic acid deriva tive, in such a  way  that (1.1.1) first (I) is reacted with (II), (1.1.2) then  the carrier (III) is introduced into the substance resulting from (1.1.1), (1.1.3) thereafter the solid-phase substance resulting from (1.1.2) is reacted with  (IV)  in  a  liquid  hydrocarbon,  with  the  proviso  that (V)  is also  introduced  in (1.1.1) or  (1.1.2) or  (1.1.3), the (1.2) the solid-phase substance resulting from (1.1) is extracted with titanium tetrachloride, and finally the solid-phase substance resulting from (1.2) is extracted with  a  liquid hydrocarbon.</p>

<p>where R1 is an aryl, alkylaryl or alkyl radical of  not more than  16,  preferably not more than  10,  carbon atoms, in particular phenyl, tolyl or  ethylphenyl, R2  is alkyl of  not  more  than  15,  preferably not  more  than  8, in particular not  more  than  4, carbon  atoms  and n is from 0  to  3, preferably  from  0  to  2, in particular 1 to  2, with the  provisos that the  atomic ratio of  titanium from the titanium component (1) to aluminum from the alumi num  component  (2) is from 1:10  to 1:800, in particular from 1:20 to 1:200, and the molar ratio of  aluminum component  (2) to  silane  component  (3)  is from 1:0.03 to 1:08,  in  particular from 1:0.05 to 1:0.5.</p>

<p>case, for example, with the process according to U.S. Pat. No.  4,399,054, or  when  other  aims  are neglected.</p>
<p>For example, British Pat. No. 2,049,709 discloses a process  in which  a  magnesium  halide, a  titanium  halide and  an  electron donor  are  applied to a  metal  oxide  car rier.  However, the polymer obtained has a compara tively low  isotacticity.</p>
<p>European Laid-Open application  Nos.  14,523 and 171,200 and British Pat. Nos. 2,101,609 and 2,101,611 describe catalyst  systems  whose  titanium component  is obtained by treating a solid, inorganic oxide with an organic magnesium compound, a Lewis base and tita nium  tetrachloride, it being  necessary  in  addition  to use a  halogenating  agent  which  is not  titanium  tetrachloride and/or  an  organic compound  of  the  metals  boron,  alu minum,  silicon or  tin or  a  boron  trihalide or  a  halogen containing alcohol. Despite an expensive and tedious preparation procedure, the productivity of  the corre sponding  catalyst  system  is unsatisfactory.</p>
<p>30  are, in absolute  terms, low. U.S. Pat. No. 4,467,044 discloses a  catalyst system which contains, as a titanium component, a silica car rier, a magnesium halide and/or manganese halide, a titanium halide and  an electron donor. In order  to ob tain catalyst systems  having relatively high productiv ity, additional treatment with an organometallic com pound  of  a  metal  of  groups  I to  III of  the  periodic  table is indispensable here. However, the productivity and stereospecificity  of  the  catalysts  prepared  in  this  manner</p>
<p>35</p>
<p>The  known  processes  are  thus unsatisfactory, in par ticular with regard to high isotacticity and good mor phology  coupled  with  good  productivity.</p>
<p>It is an object of  the present invention to provide a titanium  component  which,  compared  with  the  prior  art processes,  has  high  productivity  and  is at  the  same  time capable  of  giving  polymers  having  high  isotacticity  and good morphology.</p>
<p>45  kylchlorosilane, (IV) titanium tetrachloride and (V) a We  have  found  that  this object  is achieved  by  a  cata lyst system which contains a titanium component (1) prepared  in three  stages  in  a  particular manner  from  (I) magnesium chloride, (II) a certain alkanol, (III) a cer tain carrier comprising finely divided inorganic oxide carrier material which has been pretreated with an al specially selected phthalic  acid derivative.</p>
<p>Polymerization processes of this type are known; their special feature compared  with other similar pro cesses  is the  special embodiment  of  the  catalyst  system, and the processes disclosed in  European Laid-Open application  Nos. 17,895  and  144,021, European  Pat. No. 45,977,  Australian Pat. No.  543,049  and British Pat. No. 2,143,834 may  be  mentioned  as  prototypes  for  the  pres ent case.</p>
<p>The  special embodiments  of  the catalyst systems  are produced in order to achieve  certain aims, such  as the following: The catalyst system should be easy to prepare and  50  other  C2-C12-a-monoolefins,  in  particular  C2-C6-agive  an  increased  yield of  polymer  having  a  very  large isotactic fraction. In addition, particularly because of the thermodynamics of  the procedure, easy molecular weight regulation, in particular with hydrogen, is of great importance. 55  Ziegler-Natta  catalyst  consisting  of The  present invention accordingly relates to a pro cess for the preparation of  homopolymers  of  propene and copolymers of propene with minor amounts of monoolefins,  by  polymerization,  in  particular  dry-phase polymerization, of  the monomer  or  monomers  at from 20 to 160  C., in particular  from  50 to 120° C., under from 1 to 100, in particular from  20  to 70, bar using a</p>
<ul>
<li>(1) a titanium component which contains titanium, magnesium, chlorine  and  a  benzenecarboxylic acid de rivative on  a  carrier,</li>
<li>(2) an  aluminum  component  of  the formula</li>
</ul>
<p>AR3, where R  is alkyl of  not more  than 8, in particular not more  than 4, carbon  atoms,</p>
<p>The  catalyst system should moreover  produce  poly mers having special morphological properties, for ex ample  uniform  particle size and/or  smaller  fractions  of very  fine particles and/or  a  high bulk  density. In  addi tion to these parameters  which  are important for con  60 trolling the polymerization systems, working up the polymers and/or processing the latter, a low halogen content in the polymer is of importance, particularly with  regard  to  corrosion  problems;  this  can  be  achieved by  increasing the polymer  yield and/or  by  means  of  a  65  and catalyst system  which  contains very  little halogen.</p>
<p>Some  of  these  aims  can  be  achieved  by  the  prior art only by means of very expensive processes, as is the</p>

<p>10</p>
<p>Regarding the novel process, the following may  be stated specifically:</p>
<p>(1.3)  in a third stage,  the solid-phase intermediate obtained in the second stage is extracted with a liquid inert hydrocarbon, in particular an alkane, until the solid contains from  0.01 to 30, preferably from  0.03 to 20, in particular from  0.05 to 10, 7% by  weight  of  free titanium tetrachloride, and  the titanium component  (1) is obtained in this manner.</p>
<p>Provided that the defining feature is taken into ac count, the polymerization process as such can be  car ried out in virtually all  relevant conventional techno  15 logical  embodiments,  for  example  as  a  batchwise,  cyclic or,  in  particular,  continuous  process,  either  as  a  suspen sion  polymerization  processor,  in  particular,  a  dryphase polymerization process. The  stated technological em bodiments, i.e. the technological variants of the poly  20 merization  of  a-monoolefins  by  the  Ziegler-Natta method,  are  well  known  from  the  literature  and  in  prac tice and  therefore require  no  further description.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>according to the invention; however, phthalic anhy dride  and  the  dialkyl phthalates,  in particular di-n-butyl phthalate, are  also suitable.</p>
<p>The  alkane to be  used  for  the  preparation  of  the tita nium component (1) in stage (1.3) may  likewise be a conventional  one;  it should  advantageously  have  a  rela tively high purity.</p>
<p>The preparation of the titanium component (1)  is simple and can be carried out by the skilled worker without  explanations. Regarding  stages (1.1), (1.2) and (1.3), it is merely  necessary  to  state that  the  isolation of the  particular resulting solid is advantageously carried out by filtration  under suction,  which in stage (1.1) should advantageously  be  followed  by  washing  with  a liquid, inert hydrocarbon until the latter no longer ab sorbs  any  titanium  tetrachloride. It has  been found  that it may  also be  advantageous  if  the  solid-phase reaction product obtained in the second substance (1.1.2.a) is isolated before being  used  in the  third substage (1.1.3), for example  by  evaporation to dryness.</p>
<p>(2) Suitable aluminum components (2) of  the stated formula are the relevant conventional ones  of  this for mula; they  are  sufficiently well known  from the litera ture  and  in practice  to require  no  further  discussion.  An outstanding  member  is, for example,  triethylaluminum.</p>
<p>Regarding  the  composition  of  the  novel  catalysts, the following may  be  stated specifically: without causing damage to the catalyst system or its  35  diethoxyditolyl-, diethoxydi(ethylphenyl)-  and  diethox 30 (3) The silane component (3) which completes the catalyst system is, in particular, a  trialkoxy(alkyl)aryl or dialkoxydi(alkyl)arylsilane  of the stated  formula. Outstanding members are triethoxytolyl-, triethoxy(ethylphenyl)-,  dimethoxyditolyl-  and  dimethoxydi(ethyl phenyl)silane;  other  examples  are  trimethoxytolyl-, trimethoxy(ethylpheny)-  and  trimethoxyphenylsilane, triethoxyphenylsilane, dimethoxydiphenylsilane,  and ydiphenylsilane.</p>
<p>For  the  sake  of ompleteness,  it may  be  stated  that,  in c the novel process, it is also possible to regulate the  25 molecular  weights  of  the  polymers  by  the  relevant  con ventional measures, for example using regulators such as, in particular, hydrogen.</p>
<p>(1) The  liquid inert hydrocarbon to be used for the preparation  of  the  titanium  component  may  be  a  hydro carbon  of  the  type  usually  combined  with  titanium  com ponents for catalyst systems of  the Ziegler-Natta type titanium component. Examples of suitable hydrocar bons are pentanes, hexanes, heptanes,  gasolines and cyclohexane.</p>
<p>The  finely  divided  magnesium  chloride  (I)  likewise  to be  used may  be  a relevant conventional one. It should be essentially anhydrous, i.e.  its water content should not  exceed 1%  by  weight  of  the  total amount  of  magne sium chloride.</p>
<p>The  alkanois  (II) to  be  used  for  the  preparation  of he t titanium component  (1) may  be  conventional  ones;  they  45 should advantageously have relatively high purities. Examples of suitable alkanols are ethanol,  n-propyl alcohol,  isopropyl  alcohol,  n-butyl  alcohol,  isobutyl alcohol  and  tert-butyl  alcohol,  n-butanol  being  particu larly suitable.</p>
<p>The novel process permits homo-  and copolymers, for example of  the binary or ternary type, including block copolymers, of  propene with minor  amounts of other C2-C12-a-monoolefins to be prepared in an ad vantageous  manner,  particularly  suitable a-monoolefins as  comonomers  be  polymerized  being  ethene,  but-1-ene, 4-methylpent-1-ene  and  hex-1-ene; other  suitable exam ples are n-oct-1-ene, n-dec-1-ene.  and n-dodec-1-ene.</p>

<p>The carrier (III) furthermore to be used generally contains, as a base material, an aluminosilicate or, in particular, silica; it is important  that  it has  the  required properties; it has  been  found  that the relevant conven tional  commercial carrier  materials  which meet the  55 stated  specification  are  suitable. Alkylchlorosilanes  suit able  for  the  preparation  of  the  carrier  are  monoalkyltri chlorosilanes, dialkyldichlorosilanes and  trialkyl  mono chlorosilanes, trialkylmonochlorosilanes  being  particu larly  suitable  and  trimethylchlorosilane  being  preferred. The  titanium tetrachloride (IV) likewise to be  used for  the  preparation  of the  titanium  component (1) should  be  one  which  is conventionally used  in Ziegler Natta catalyst systems. Furthermore,  the  phthalic  acid  derivative  (V)  defined  65  parts, i.e. a  total of  100  molar  parts,  of  the  hydrocarbon above can be a commercial one; it  should advanta geously  be  very  pure.
