## PROCESS  FOR  THE  PREPARATION  OFA CATALYST  AND  CATALYST  USED IN OLEFN POLYMERZATION

The  present  invention relates to the  preparation of  a catalyst for the polymerization of  ethylene and  higher 1-olefins.

25

A  process  for  the  preparation of  a  catalyst for  use  in the polymerization of olefins has been described, in  10 which organic alkali metal compounds  are allowed to act on the hydroxyl groups of  finely dispersed metal oxides, for example silicon dioxide, and the reaction product is  reacted subsequently with a metal halide selected from  group  VIIa  of  the  Periodic  system,  espe  15 cially manganese  hexachloride  (cf. U.S.  Pat.  No. 3,205,177). The  solid obtained gives  a  catalyst suitable for use in the olefin polymerization when combined with  a  metallo-organic  compound  the  metal  of  which  is selected from one of  groups I to III of  the periodic  20 system. These  catalysts, however, have  a low  activity and produce only 1.4 kg of  polyethylene per gram of manganese  in 3 hours  at a polymerization temperature of  95  C. and under  an  ethylene pressure of  98  atmo spheres.

A  further process comprises impregnating a solid carrier, for  example  calcium carbonate, with  an  alumi num-organic compound and treating it  subsequently with an excess of  titanium tetrachloride, whereby re duced titanium trichloride forms a sediment on the 30 carrier (cf.  British  Pat.  No. 927,969). Thereafter the excess  of  titanium tetrachloride must  be  removed.  The polymerization activity of  the catalysts thus obtained, however, is likewise so low that the residual catalyst must  be  removed  from  the  polyolefin produced. 35

dium  are used  in  an  amount  such  that  the  separation of  45  from  50  to 1000  m2/g,  preferably  from  100  to  800,  espe sure of  39  atmospheres. A econdary treatment of  the  55  groups  per  gram  of  carrier. Several of  these  oxides are Suitable  carriers  are  porous  oxides  or  mixed  oxides  of silicon and/or aluminum having a specific surface of cially  from  150  to  650  and  a  pore  volume n  the  range  of i from 0.2 to 2 ml/g, preferably of  from 0.4 to 2, espe cially of  from  0.6  to 1.7  ml/g.  The  particle  size  is  in the range of  from 1 to 500 am, preferably from 10 to 200 um, especially of  from 20  to 100 um.  The  number  of hydroxyl  groups  depends  on  the  specific  surface  and  the temperature of  the preliminary treatment and  is in the range  of  from  0.5  to  50  mmols referably  of  from 1  to  20 p mmols, especially of  from 1.5 to 10 mmols, hydroxyl prepared especially for being used  as a carrier of  sup ported catalysts. They  are  commercial  products.

periodical  system,  and  the  excess  of  the  transition  metal compound  is removed  by  washing with a solvent. By washing  out  the metallo-organic  compounds  of  magne sium or aluminum and the transition metals there are formed  highly  diluted  solutions,  which  must  be  decom posed  subsequently.  As   consquence  thereof,  undesired a waste  products  are  obtained,  which  are  contained  in  the waste  water  (cf. German Offenlegungsschrift  No. 2,109,273).

It has  now  been  found  that  a  catalyst  suitable  for  use in the polymerization of 1-olefins can be obtained by starting from the reaction product of  silicon dioxide and/or  a metal oxide  with  a  Grignard compound  as a carrier and a soluble titanium compound, which cata lyst gives high yields and  allows  a  good  control of  the molecular  weight  by  means  of  hydrogen  without  mak ing a  separation of  the excess of  metallo-organic com pounds  and/or  of  titanium  compounds  from  the  carrier necessary.

The  present invention consequently provides a pro cess for the preparation of  a catalyst by reacting the reaction product of silicon dioxide and/or aluminum oxide and 1. a halogen-containing magnesium-organic compound  and 2. a halogen compound  of  a  transition metal  (component  A)  with  a  metallo-organic  compound (component B), which  comprises reacting a  silicon di oxide and/or aluminum oxide having  a  hydroxyl con tent of  from  0.5 to  50  mmols/g  first with  a  magnesium compound  of  the formula RMgX,  in which R s a  hy i droxarbon  radical  having  from  1 to  20  carbon  atoms  and X  is chlorine, bromine or iodine, in the presence of  a diluent, in an  amount  of  from  0.05 to 1  mol  of  magne sium compound per mol of hydroxyl groups of the carrier and  reacting thereafter the  solid reaction prod uct in suspension with a halogen-containing titanium (IV)  compound  of  the  formula  TiX(OR))4-,  in  which n  is an  integer  of  rom 1 to  4, X  s chlorine  or  bromine f i and R  is a  hydrocarbon  radical  having  of  from  1 to 12 carbon atoms, in an amount of  from 0.01 to 1  mol of titanium compound  per  mol  of  hydroxyl  groups  of  the carrier, to obtain the component  A.

Finally a process for the preparation of  supported catalysts has been disclosed, in which an excess of  a metallo-organic magnesium  or aluminum  compound  is allowed to act  on  silicon dioxide, aluminum  oxide or  a mixture consisting of silicon  dioxide and aluminum oxide  having  superficial hydroxyl  groups  and  the reac tion product  is reacted,  after  the  excess  of  said  organo  65  whereby  it is reduced  with  an  increasing temperature. metallic  compound  has  been  removed  by  washing,  with an excess of  a  halogen compound  of  a  transition metal selected from one of groups IVa, Va  or VIa of the Prior to the reaction of  the hydroxyl groups of  the carrier  with  the  halogen-containing  magnesium-organic compounds the absorbed water must be removed by drying  at  a  temperature  of  from  120 to  800Â° C.,  prefera bly of  from  200  to 500  C. The  number  of  hydroxyl groups (mmol  of  hydroxyl groups  per  gram  of  carrier) may  be  modified  by  said  treatment  at  high  temperature, After drying the carrier is kept under an inert gas atmosphere, for example nitrogen or argon, with the exclusion of  air or  water.

Furthermore, there are known catalysts used in the polymerization  of  olefins, which  are  obtained  by  treat ing  an  oxide,  hydroxide,  carbonate  or  sulfate of  magne sium or  calcium with an  aluminum-organic compound and  subsequently reacting  the  compound  obtained  with a mixture  of  halides  of  titanium  and  vanadium  (cf. Ger man  Auslegeschrift No. 2,140,326). In the preparation of  these  catalysts  the  aluminum-organic  compound  and the transition metal compound of  titanium and vana an excess of  these compounds  may  be  dispensed with, but  on  the  other  hand,  active  catalysts  for  the  polyolefin polymerization  cannot  be  obtained  when  using  as  transi tion metal compounds solely titanium compounds. A catalyst, for example, which  had  been prepared  by  re 50 acting magnesium  oxide  with  aluminum  triethyl and  by subsequently treating the product obtained with tita nium  tetrachloride  yielded  per  hour  only  19.5g  of  oly p ethylene  per 1 gram  of  titanium  under  an  ethylene  pres s polyethylene  obtained was necessary for removing  the residual catalyst because of  the discoloration of  poly ethylene.

These compounds are known as Grignard  compounds  and  may  be  prepared,  for  example by reaction of  metallic magnesium with a halogenhy drocarbon  having  from  1 to 20,  preferably  from  2  to 10 carbon  atoms,  for  example  an  alkyl,  -cycloalkyl-or  aryl halide, in the presence of  a nucleophilic solvent, for example  an  ether  (cf.

The separated diluent may be reused after having been recovered.

The solid carrier impregnated with the Grignard compound is  thereafter suspended again in an inert dispersing  agent,  preferably  in an  inert  hydrocarbon.  A dispersing  agent  conventionally used  for  the  polymeri zation  under low pressure  according  to  Ziegler  is chosen preferably.

To the suspension obtained there is  added subse quently a halogen-containing titanium(IV) compound, at a temperature of  from 20 to 140  C., preferably of from  30  to 130 C,  especially  of  from  40  to 120Â° C.  and the  mixture  is  stirred  at  this  temperature  until  a  titanium compound  can no  longer  be  detected in the  suernatant solution, generally within a period of from 2 to 20 hours.

Titanium tetrachloride, TiCl2(O-i-C3H)2 and TiCl 3(O-i-C3H7) are  used  preferably.

The Grignard compound reacts in known manner with the hydroxyl groups placed at the surface of  the carrier at a temperature below 100Â°  C. while splitting off hydrocarbon, with the addition of  -Mgx  to the oxygen  of  the  hydroxyl  group  according  to the  follow ing equation:

The  proportion  of  Grignard  compound  and  solid carrier is chosen such that from 0.05 to 1, preferably from  0.1 to  0.95, mol  of  alkyl magnesium  halide  is used per  mole  of  hydroxyl  groups  of  the  carrier. The  magne  50 sium  compound  is applied on  the  carrier quantitatively in said process. The reaction is  completed when no more magnesium can be detected in the supernatant solution after the  solid carrier has  settled.

---o-it-oh  -- RMgX  -o-i-o-Mex  -- R-H -O -O Consequently one mol of  magnesium alkyl chloride is chemically bound  per mole  of  hydroxyl groups  of  the carrier. The  number  of  hydroxyl  groups  of  the carrier  35  branched  alkyl  radical  having  from  1 to  8  carbon  atoms, may, consequently, be determined by volumetric or chromatographic analysis of  the hydrocarbon formed or  by  retitration of  the  excess  of  Grignard  compound. 30 compound  of  the formula  TiXn  (OR)4-,  wherein n  is The  halogen-containing titanium(IV) compound  is a an  integer  of  from 1 to 4  and  X  s chlorine  or  bromine i and R is a hydrocarbon radical, preferably an alkyl, aryl or  aralkyl radical having  from 1 to 12, preferably from 1 to  8  carbon  atoms,  especially  a  straight  chain  or for  example  TiCl4,  TiCl3,  (O-n-C3H7),  TiCl2(O-nC3H7)2,  TiCl(O-n-C3H7)3,  TiCl2(O-1-C3H)2,  TiCl3(O-iC3H7),  TiCl3(O-CH2C6H5),  TiCl2(O-CH2C6H5)2,  TiCl 3(O-i-C4H9) and  TiCl2(O-i-C4H9)2.

The  proportion  between  the  titanium  compound  and the  solid carrier is chosen  such  that of  from  0.01 to 1, preferably  of  from  0.05  to 1, especially  of  from  0.1 to 1, mol of  titanium compound  is used per 1  mole of  hy droxyl groups  of  the  solid carrier.

The  proportion of, Grignard compound  to the tita nium  compound  is chosen  such that the  atomic  ratio of magnesium  to  titanium  in  the  catalyst  component  A  s  in i the range  of  from  0.01 to 10, preferably  of  from  0.05  to 5, especially of  from  0.1 to 2.

Suitable diluents  are  all solvents inert with regard  to  55 Grignard  compounds,  for  example  saturated hydrocar bons or ethers, for example pentane, hexane, heptane, diethyl  ether,  tetrahydrofurane,  or mixture  of both types  of  compounds.

Suitable  compounds  for  the  component  B re  organic a compounds  of  the  metals  selected  from  one  of  the  main groups I, II and III of  the  periodic  system. Aluminum organic compounds  are preferably used as component B.

The  catalyst component  A  thus obtained is used ei ther directly in the form of  the suspension or  after re moval  of  the diluent  and  drying.

After  completion  of  the  above  reaction the  diluent  is separated  by  filtration  and  drying  or  directly  by  distilla tion, at a  temperature  of  from  50  to  200  C., if  it con tains  an  ether.  The  separation  of  the  diluent  is necessary for removing the ether, which has been used for the preparation of  the Grignard compound  and formed a  65  bon  atoms.  The  reaction  products  of  aluminum  trialkyls complex  with  said  compound,  owing  to  the  fact  that  the ether also reacts with the titanium compound while forming  a  complex  and  deactivates the  catalyst. 60 Suitable aluminum-organic compounds  are the reac tion products of  aluminum-trialkyls or aluminum dial kyl  hydrides,  containing  alkyl radicals  having  from  1 to 16 carbon  atoms, with dienes having  from  4  to 20  car or aluminum-dialkyl  hydrides,  the  alkyl  radicals  of which have from 4 to 8 carbon atoms, for example phellandrene of  a  diene of  the formula

Examples of such olefins  are  ethylene,  propylene,  butene-1,  hexene-1, 4-methyl-pentene-1, octene-1.  Ethylene is  preferably polymerized  alone  or  as  a  mixture  consisting  of  at  least 70%  by  weight  of  ethylene  and  at  most  30%  by  weight of  a  further 1-olefin of  the  above  formula. Ethylene  is especially  polymerized  either  alone  or  as  a  mixture  of t a least 92%  by weight of  ethylene and at most 8%  by weight  of  a  further 1-olefin of  the  above  formula.

The  polymerization  may  be  carried  out  in  solution,  in suspension or in the gaseous phase, continuously or discontinuously,  at  a  temperature  of  from  20  to 150  C., preferably of  from  60 to 140  C., under  a  pressure of from  0.5  to  50 ars.

Higher  concentrations  are also possible principally.

The  polymerization in suspension or  solution is car ried  out  in a  conventional  inert  solvent  for  low  pressure processes according to Ziegler, which have been de scribed above.

Further suitable compounds for component B are chlorine-containing aluminum-organic compounds, for example dialkyl aluminum monochlorides of the for mula  R52AlCl  or  alkyl  aluminum  sesqui-chlorides  of  the formula  R53Al2Cl3,  wherein  R5  is  a  hydrocarbon  radical having from 1  to 16 carbon  atoms, preferably an  alkyl radical having from 1  to 16, especially from 2 to 12 carbon atoms.

Especially suitable compounds  for the component B are aluminum trialkyls of  the formula AllR3  or  alumi num  dialkyl hydrides of  the formula  AllR2H,  wherein R5  is a  hydrocarbon  radical  having  from 1 to 16  carbon atoms,  preferably an  alkyl radical having  from 1 to 16, especially  from 2 to  4 carbon atoms, for example Al(C2H5)3,  Al(C2H5)2H  Al(C3H7)2H,  Al(i-C4H9)3,  Al(iC4H9)2H. The conversion of the titanium(IV) compound of  60  machines  do  not  occur.  Thus  expensive  operations  such component  A  nto  the  polymerization  active  compound i having a lower valency is advantageously performed during the  polymerization  by  the  metallo-organic  com pound  (component B) at a  temperature of  from 20' to 150Â° C., preferably  of  from  60' to 140  C. 45 55  the  invention  gives  high  catalyst  yields  under  low  pres 65  highly  improved with an increasing polymerization The  process according to the invention has the ad vantage  that  excessive  metal  compounds  do  not  have  to be  removed  from  the  catalyst  component  A y  washing, b owing  to  the  fact  that  both  the  halogen-containing  mag nesium-organic compound used and the halogen-con taining titanium(IV) compound react completely with the  carrier. Consequently,  no  washing  liquids  are rated prior to the secondary treatment. As a conse quence thereof there are formed no metal-containing waste water or  slurries. During the polymerization of ethylene and  higher 1-olefins the  catalyst  according to sure, for example of from 1  to 7 bars, such that the magnesium/titanium  and  aluminum compound may completely  remain  in  the  polymer;  a  discoloration  of  the polyolefin or corrosion phenomena on the processing as  a  decomposition  of  the  catalyst  and  a  removal  of  the catalyst may  be  dispensed  with. Carrying  out  the  poly merization  under  a  higher  pressure  permits  use  of  a  still smaller quantity of catalyst,  as the catalyst yield  is pressure.

The  catalyst according  to the invention is especially suitable for the polymerization of  ethylene in the  gase

Component A  may also be treated with a metallo organic compound  prior to polymerizing and be used subsequently in the  polymerization  at a temperature  of

7

ous phase in a fluidized bed. The  use of  oxide  carriers having  a  particle size of  more  than  30  Jum, which  may be  obtained for example  by  separating  fine  particles  by sieving, prevents finely divided catalysts or polymer parts from being carried out of the fluidized bed and forming  deposits in exterior zones  of  the reactor.

8

particle size  of  70 um  is dried  for 6  hours  in  a  fluidized bed at 460  C. under an argon atmosphere and kept under an argon atmosphere. The number  of  hydroxyl groups  is 1.7 mmols  of  hydroxy  groups  per 1 g  of  silicic acid.

20

The  catalyst  according  to  the  invention  permits  prep aration  of  a  polymer,  the  powder  in  bulk  of  which  has  a high air permeability and thus may  directly be  used in the processing  by  injection molding  or  extrusion with 10  ether  are  added  and  the  mixture  is heated  for  4  hours  to out  previous  granulation.  A ood  air  permeability  of he g t powder  in  bulk  in  the  extruder  feeding  zone  prevents  an incorporation of air into the molten polymer, which would  cause  a  formation  of  bubbles  in  the  finished part. The  porous  silicon dioxide having  one  or more  sur 15 face OH  groups is designated as "silicic acid' in the examples. 107 g  of  this silicic acid are  suspended  in 500  ml  of nheptane under  an  argon  atmosphere,  343  ml  of  a  solu tion of  172  mmols  of  n-propyl magnesium  chloride  (1.6 mnols  of  magnesium  per 1  g  of  silicic acid) in diethyl 50Â° C. The  solvent is withdrawn  thereafter in a rotary evaporator  and  the  solid product  is dried  for  2  hours  at 120Â°  C. under  0.5 torr. Thereafter the  solid product  is suspended  in 500  ml  of  n-heptane  under  an  argon  atmo sphere, 20.3 g  of  titanium tetrachloride (1.0 mmol  of titanium per 1 g  of  silicic acid) are  added  and  the mix ture  is stirred  for  7  hours  at  90Â° C.  Heptane  is  thereafter withdrawn at 120Â° C. in the rotary evaporator under atmospheric pressure.  128 g of  a flowable powder is obtained.

The  titanium  analysis  reveals  39.8  mg  of  titanium  per 1  g  of  the  component  A.  The  atomic ratio of  magnesi um/titanium  is 1.6:1.

25

For  determining the number  of  hydroxyl groups of the carrier 10.0 g  of  the dried silicic acid are reacted under  an  argon  atmosphere  while  refluxing  and  stirring with a solution of  500 mmols of  n-propyl magnesium chloride in 500 ml of  diethyl ether, for a period of  4 hours. After settling of  the silicic acid magnesium is retitrated in the supernatant solution by  way  of  com plexometry.

The  titanium content of  component  A  s determined i colorimetrically  by  using  hydrogen  peroxide  (cf. G.  O. Muller, Praktikum der quantitativen chemischen Ana lyse, 4th edition, (1957), page  243).

For  the polymerization in suspension there is used  a hydrated Diesel oil fraction having  a  boiling range of from 140 to 200 C.

The  melt  index  of  the  polymer  is determined  accord ing to DIN  (German Industrial Standard) 53,735, at 190Â° C.,  by  using  a  load  of    kg  for  is  and  of  15  kg or  i15. 5 f
