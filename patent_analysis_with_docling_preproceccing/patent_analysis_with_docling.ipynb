Indeed, when the Xylene soluble content of  the polymer  is present in a  high concentration (&gt;10%)  and  with  a  low  molecular  weight,  this soluble content  tends to migrate  to the film Surface causing blocking,  in addition to the unsatisfactory optical properties (low  gloss  and  high haze).\n",

Particularly,  in  the  gas  phase  reac tors, the  presence  offines  with  low  bulk  density  causes  prob  55 lems. In fact, due to the friction of  the polymer  particles present in the reactor, the fines are especially prone to the formation of  electrostatic charges and tend to deposit and adhere  to the metallic walls. These  stagnant  deposits do not allow  the  exchange  of  the  reaction  heat  and  ecome ot  spots, b h which  can  form  layers  of  agglomerates  containing  eventually melt  polymer.
