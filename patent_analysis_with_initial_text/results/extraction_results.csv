 PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF 
 POLYETHYLENE 
 TECHNICAL FIELD 
 This invention relates to a proceSS for the preparation of 
 polyethylene with a focus on catalyst activation. 
 BACKGROUND INFORMATION 
 Polyethylene has long been prepared with Ziegler-Natta 
 catalyst Systems, which typically include a catalyst precur 
 Sor made up of transition metal(s) and an electron donor, and a cocatalyst. In order to obtain the high level of catalyst activity essential to commercial polymerization processes, it 
 is necessary to provide for essentially complete activation of 
 the precursor. It should be noted, however, that catalyst 
 activity in these Systems is also affected by a number of 
 other variables including the method of catalyst manufacture 
 or formation, the use of internal electron donors, the chemi 
 cal composition of the internal electron donor, and the total 
 amount of internal electron donor. 
 Once the basic catalyst is formed, it is necessary to 
 remove internal electron donor from the vicinity of the active site and (if necessary) chlorinate and/or reduce the 
 valence site of the active metal. Electron donor (ED) is complexed or reacted away from the active Site by either activator compound (defined as an Al compound which is capable of reducing TiCl, to Ti"" valency; such compounds 
 can be generically described as RAIX, wherein X is a halogen, typically Cl; n ranges from 1 to 3 with preferred 
 values ranging from 1.5 to 3; and R is preferably CH, CH5, 
 iCHo, nC. Ho, nCH, or nGHz) or by a Lewis acid (typically RMX, wherein n+m=the valency of M; R is an alkyl or alkoxy or aryloxy group; X is a halogen; and M=B, 
 Al, or Si). The formula of a non-activator Lewis Acid can be RBX, wherein X=0 to 2. It is desirable to supply sufficient 
 activator or Lewis acid to remove at least 90 percent and preferably close to 100 percent of the ED compound from 
 the active site. Due to chemical equilibria, it may be nec essary to add a greater than Stoichiometric amount of 
 activator compound to electron donor to fully activate the catalyst. Activation can be accomplished by partial activa 
 tion before introduction of the precursor into the reactor and 
 completion of the activation in the reactor by means of the cocatalyst, or full activation prior to introduction of the 
 precursor into the reactor. 
 The disadvantages of partial activation lie in the require ment for additional proceSS StepS and equipment to provide 
 the partially activated precursor followed by final activation 
 in the reactor, which requires excessive amounts of activator compound, i.e., cocatalyst (typically, aluminum alkyl 
 compounds), to be added to the reactor So that an adequate 
 concentration of activator compound is present at the active 
 polymerization site. AS noted above, the function of this activator compound is to extract electron donor compound 
 from the potential active site and to activate the active site either by alkylation (if the active site is already at the correct Valence State) or by reduction and alkylation if the active site valence state requires reduction, for example, from Ti"" to Ti"". In addition to being wasteful, this excess activator compound can cause operational problems or detriment to 
 the final product. 
 Typical preactivated catalysts are described in U.S. Pat. 
 Nos. 4,482,687; 4,508,842; and 5,290,745. Preactivated catalysts of the prior art can be formulated with sufficient activator compound to fully activate the precursor compo 15

 Sition; however, putting large amounts of activator com pound directly onto these catalysts can also result in 
 deactivation, catalysts which are hazardous to handle due to pyrophoricity, or catalysts which have poor flow properties. 
 Some of these disadvantages can be addressed by dispersing the catalyst in a carrier Such as an inert hydrocarbon; however, the disadvantage of needing multiple operations to produce the catalyst and the inability to adjust the final 
 catalyst composition to account for variations in monomer 
 quality are Serious limitations for commercial operation. A 
 further limitation for commercial operation is the need to dilute the catalyst sufficiently with the inert hydrocarbon to 
 prevent deactivation of the catalyst due to high concentra tion of activator compound in the catalyst Slurry. 
 The use of excess amounts of cocatalyst in Ziegler-Natta catalyzed polymerizations is Standard practice in the art. 
 Typical Al/Ti molar ratios used in prior art processes are 
 usually greater than 20:1, and many are in the 50:1 to 100:1 range. In the description of these processes, lower values are 
 mentioned, but clearly are not preferred. In other prior art, 
 very low levels of added aluminum alkyl ranging from 0.1:1 to about 10:1 are Suggested, but the catalyst Systems 
 involved here are devoid of electron donor type compounds, 
 and So are not relevant to the processes under discussion in this specification. A typical non-ED System is described in 
 U.S. Pat. No. 5,077,358. 
 Prepolymerization Systems are also mentioned in the prior 
 art. Typical examples of this kind of catalyst System are 
 mentioned in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,077,358 and 4,990,479. These 
 Systems also do not use internal electron donors, and addi tion of extra aluminum alkyl activator component can lead to catalyst productivity increases to Such an extent that 
 Severe operational instabilities are observed. These catalysts are typically activated in the prepolymer preparation with 
 low amounts of an aluminum alkyl activator compound and 
 frequently with the use of an external electron donor. While “free” aluminum alkyl may be removed from the prepoly 
 mer prior to use in the main polymerization reactor, the prepolymer catalysts are fully activated in the reactor with 
 large exceSS amounts of cocatalyst. 
 European Patent Application 783 007 discloses a process for production of polyethylene using reduced amounts of 
 aluminum alkyl feed; however, this disclosure focuses exclusively on the use of external addition of additional activator compound, i.e., Separate activator and catalyst 
 feeds, and overall Al/Timolar ratios, which are at the lower 
 end of the higher ratios recited above for electron donor bearing catalysts. Operating in this mode introduces other Specific problems, Such as the need for exceptionally precise 
 control of cocatalyst feed rates to avoid reaction runaway and agglomerate formation. A further disadvantage of 
 “starved” activator feed is that the hydrogen response of the catalyst, i.e. the relative hydrogen:ethylene mole ratio 
 required to achieve a given molecular weight at otherwise 
 constant reaction conditions, is dramatically effected requir ing larger amounts of hydrogen to achieve the same given 
 molecular weight or melt index. 
 Although good polymerization activity is achievable by 
 adding external activator compound, the fact that catalyst 
 and activator compound are added Separately requires exces 
 Sive amounts of activator compound to keep the required 
 amount of activator compound at the desired level at the active polymerization site. ExceSS activator compound also 
 can cause formation of oils, can over-activate Some Sites 
 thus forming highly branched materials which are 
 undesirable, and can, in the extreme, actually cause catalyst activity decreases. US 6,617.405 B1

 DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION 
 An object of this invention, therefore, is to provide a proceSS for preparing polyethylene, which overcomes the 
 deficiencies associated with Separate and/or excessive addi tion of cocatalyst aluminum alkyl. Other objects and advan 
 tages will become apparent hereinafter. 
 According to the present invention, Such a process has been discovered. The process entails contacting ethylene per 
 Se or ethylene and one or more comonomers in one or more fluidized bed reactors, under polymerization conditions, with a catalyst System comprising (i) a Supported or unsup ported magnesium/titanium based precursor in Slurry form, 
 said precursor containing an electron donor; and (ii) an 
 activator in an amount Sufficient to complete the activation of the precursor. The invention lies in an improvement to this process comprising 
 (A) mixing the precursor and the activator prior to intro 
 duction into the reactor in two or three Steps, the last Step being a topping-off Step in which activation is completed; 
 (B) maintaining the mixture from Step (A) in Slurry form; 
 and 
 (C) introducing the mixture from Step (B) into the reactor with the following provisos: 
 (I) the atomic ratio of aluminum to titanium is in the range of about 1:1 to about 15:1 and the mole ratio 
 of activator to electron donor is about 1:1 to about 
 2:1; (II) the activator is one compound or a sequential 
 mixture of two different compounds, (III) each activator compound has the formula Al(R) Xs wherein each R is independently a saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon radical having 1 to 14 carbon 
 atoms, each X is independently chlorine, bromine, or 
 iodine, and n is 1 to 3, (IV) the activation of the precursor is essentially com pleted prior to the introduction of the precursor into 
 the reactor; and 
 (V) no additional activator is introduced into the reactor (S). 
 DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED 
 EMBODIMENT(S) 
 The gaseous materials used in the process can be intro 
 duced into the reactors via a recycle gas. The recycle gas is defined as a mixture of gases including ethylene per Se or ethylene and one or more alpha-olefins, preferably one or 
 two alpha-olefins, as comonomers and, optionally, one or more inert gases Such as nitrogen (to make up the desired reactor pressure), inert hydrocarbons, and hydrogen. The alpha-olefins can be, for example, propylene, 1-butene, 
 1-hexene, 4-methyl-1-pentene, and 1-octene. The alpha 
 olefins usually have no more than 12 carbon atoms, and preferably, 3 to 8 carbon atoms. The recycle gas can also be 
 referred to as the inlet gas or cycle gas. 
 The catalyst system can be exemplified by one where the 
 precursor is formed by Spray drying and used in Slurry form. 
 Such a catalyst precursor, for example, contains titanium, 
 magnesium, and an electron donor, and, optionally, an 
 aluminum halide. The precursor is introduced into a hydro 
 carbon medium Such as mineral oil to provide a slurry. This 
 spray dried catalyst is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,290,745. 
 Other processes are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,601,742 and 4,482,687. In whichever manner the catalyst precursor is produced, the precursor is preferably Suspended in an 15 
 25

 65 4 
 inert, high Viscosity fluid, e.g., a moderately high Viscosity 
 mineral oil, to allow efficient blending of the activator compound. 
 A typical magnesium/titanium based catalyst System can 
 be described as follows: 
 The precursor can have the formula MgTiOR).X(ED), wherein R is an aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon radical 
 having 1 to 14 carbon atoms or COR' wherein R' is an aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon radical having 1 to 14 
 carbon atoms; each OR group is the same or different; X is independently chlorine, bromine or iodine, ED is an electron 
 donor; d is 0.5 to 56; e is 0, 1, or 2; f is 2 to 116; and g is 1.5d+2. It is prepared from a titanium compound, a magne 
 Sium compound, and an electron donor. Titanium compounds, which are useful in preparing these precursors, 
 have the formula Ti(OR), X, wherein R, X, and e are as defined above, h is an integer from 1 to 4, and e--h is 3 or 4. Some specific examples of titanium compounds are TiCl, 
 TiCl, Ti(OCH) Br; Ti(OCH)Cl; and Ti(OCOCH) Cls. TiCl and TiCl, are preferred compounds. The magne sium compounds include magnesium halides Such as MgCl, MgBr, and Mg2. Anhydrous MgCl2 is a preferred com 
 pound. About 0.5 to about 56, and preferably about 1 to about 10, moles of the magnesium compounds are used per 
 mole of titanium compound. 
 The electron donor is an organic Lewis base, liquid at temperatures in the range of about 0 degrees C. to about 200 
 degrees C., in which the magnesium and titanium com 
 pounds are Soluble. The electron donor can be an alkyl ester of an aliphatic or aromatic carboxylic acid, an aliphatic 
 ketone, an aliphatic amine, an aliphatic alcohol, an alkyl or 
 cycloalkyl ether, or mixtures thereof, each electron donor 
 having 2 to 20 carbon atoms. Among these electron donors, the preferred are alkyl and cycloalkyl ethers having 2 to 20 
 carbon atoms, dialkyl, diaryl, and alkylaryl ketones having 
 3 to 20 carbon atoms, and alkyl, alkoxy, and alkylalkoxy esters of alkyl and aryl carboxylic acids having 2 to 20 
 carbon atoms. The most preferred electron donor is tetrahy 
 drofuran. Other examples of Suitable electron donors are methyl formate, ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, ethyl ether, 
 dioxane, di-n-propyl ether, dibutyl ether, ethanol, 1-butanol, ethyl formate, methyl acetate, ethyl anisate, ethylene 
 carbonate, tetrahydropyran, and ethyl propionate. Alcohol 
 containing electron donors which react with the transition metal halide compounds are not preferred. 
 While an excess of electron donor is used initially to provide the reaction product of titanium compound and 
 electron donor, the reaction product finally contains about 1 
 to about 20 moles of electron donor per mole of titanium compound and preferably about 1 to about 10 moles of 
 electron donor per mole of titanium compound. 
 The activators that can be used in the invention are 
 compounds of the formula RAIX. Compounds of the 
 formula RBX, (where n is 0 to 2) are typical Lewis acids, which are not activator compounds, but are useful in the 
 instant invention. The activator/Lewis acid compounds are added preferably in the same inert diluent as the catalyst precursor. The precursor activator used in the pre-activation 
 can be one compound or a mixture of two different com pounds. Each compound can have the formula (R)AIX, wherein each R is independently a Saturated aliphatic hydro 
 carbon radical having 1 to 14 carbon atoms; each X is a halogen, preferably independently chlorine, bromine, or 
 iodine, and n is 1 to 3. Examples of the R radical are methyl, ethyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, n-hexyl and n-octyl. Preferred acti 
 vators include diethyl aluminum chloride, triethyl US 6,617.405 B1 
 S 
 aluminum, tri-n-hexyl aluminum, dimethyl aluminum chloride, and tri-n-octyl aluminum. Particularly preferred 
 activators are: a Sequential mixture of tri-n-hexylaluminum 
 and diethylaluminum chloride; a Sequential mixture of tri ethylaluminum and diethylaluminum chloride; a Sequential 
 mixture of diethylaluminum chloride and tri-n- heXylaluminum; a Sequential mixture of diethylaluminum 
 chloride and triethylaluminum; and either diethyl aluminum 
 chloride or tri-n-hexyl aluminum. 
 In the Sequential mixture, it is preferred to have the first 
 precursor activator (Activator 1) of the formula AlR and the Second precursor activator (Activator 2) of formula Al(R) 
 Xs, wherein R, X, and n are the same as above. Preferred mole ratioS of Activator 2 to Activator 1 range from about 
 1:1 to about 6:1. 
 The activators can also be represented by the formulas RA1 or RAIX wherein each R is independently alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, or hydrogen; at least one R is hydrocarbyl, 
 and two or three R radicals can be joined to form a heterocyclic structure. Each R, which is a hydrocarbyl 
 radical, can have 1 to 20 carbon atoms, and preferably has 1 to 10 carbon atoms. X is a halogen, preferably chlorine, 
 bromine, or iodine. 
 Examples of hydrocarbyl aluminum activators, in addi 
 tion to those mentioned above, are as follows: tri isobutylaluminum, di-isobutyl-aluminum hydride, dihexyla 
 luminum hydride, di-isobutyl-hexylaluminum, isobutyl diheXylaluminum, trimethylaluminum, tripropylaluminum, 
 trii Sopropylaluminum, tri-n-butyl aluminum, tridecylaluminum, tridodecylaluminum, tribenzylaluminum, 
 trip he nylaluminum, trinaphthylaluminum, tritolylaluminum, isoprenylaluminum, dibutylaluminum 
 chloride, diisobutylaluminum chloride, and ethylaluminum SeSquichloride. 
 Essentially complete activation of the precursor is carried 
 out prior to the introduction of the precursor into the reactor. Depending on Specific chemical equilibria, the total amount 
 of activator can range from about 1 mole of activator per 
 mole of electron donor to about 2 moles of activator per mole of electron donor. This ratio also applies to each 
 activator when two activators are used, but the total amount 
 of activator(s) will not be in excess of this ratio. It will be 
 understood that after this activation, no additional activators 
 are added to the reactor(s). 
 In a preferred mode (Sometimes referred to as an in-line reduction System), the precursor is introduced into a hydro 
 carbon Solvent slurry feed tank; the Slurry then passes to a 
 Static mixer immediately downstream of an activator injec 
 tion port where the slurry is mixed with the activator; then the mixture passes to a Second Static mixer immediately 
 downstream of a Second activator injection port where it is 
 mixed with the Second activator. The Second activator is 
 optional, but preferred. The mixture then passes to another 
 mixer, preferably of the same kind, where it is topped-off 
 with a Small amount of activator Sufficient to complete 
 activation of the precursor, i.e., an amount Sufficient to alkylate the active site and promote polymerization. A Small 
 additional amount may also be included to counteract impu rities found in the polymerization System; however, this 
 amount is inclusive in the overall Al:Ti atomic ratio, i.e., 
 about 1:1 to about 15:1, preferably about 1:1 to about 10:1, 
 and is not in excess of that ratio. 
 The static mixer element is preferably mounted vertically 
 to prevent Solids accumulation in the mixer. It makes no 
 difference which direction the flow is going, however. A 32 
 element Static mixer in 72 inch tube size is highly efficacious. 15

 The 32 element mixer (overall length is 24.75 inch) will have a relatively low pressure drop while Still providing 
 intimate mixing of the fluid elements. The Static mixer element is preferably located downstream of the injection point of alkyl reducing agent to the precursor Slurry. There 
 is no requirement that the mixer element be within a certain minimum distance of the mix point; however, any distance from a few inches to a few feet may be acceptable depending 
 on the overall System layout and dimensions. The Static mixer element may be jacketed or not. In any case, the 
 System should, at a minimum, be insulated to prevent heat loSS to the environment. Acceptable mixing can be provided 
 by a 2 foot (32 element) Kenics TM static mixer. This low energy mixer functions by constantly dividing the flow and 
 reversing flow directions in a circular pattern in the direction 
 of the flow in the tube associated with the mixer. Depending on the activator used, Some reaction time may be required 
 for the reaction of the activator with the catalyst precursor. 
 This is conveniently done using a residence time Zone, 
 which can consist either of an additional length of slurry feed pipe or an essentially plug flow holding vessel. A 
 residence time Zone can be used for both activators, for only one or for neither, depending entirely on the rate of reaction between activator and catalyst precursor. See discussion of 
 residence time pots below. The entire mixture, after the topping-off Step, is then introduced into the reactor, usually 
 at the same time as the flow of ethylene is initiated. 
 It is noted that due to the high viscosity of the slurry, heat transfer is relatively poor (the Reynolds number is in the 1 to 10 range). Degradation can begin to occur at temperatures 
 higher than 60 degrees C. Thus, activation is normally 
 effected at temperatures in the range of about 10 to about 60 degrees C., preferably about 30 to about 45 degrees C. In any 
 case, good mixing is needed to maintain constant tempera 
 tures and allow for completion of the reaction in view of the prevalent low mass transfer coefficients in high Viscosity Systems. Intense high energy input mixing, mixing by injec 
 tion into a flowing Stream, and mixing by diffusion are not 
 recommended. 
 To assure a uniform final catalyst precursor, it is important 
 that the flow through the mixing devices be as close to plug 
 flow as possible. In addition, Some of the reactions require 
 finite amounts of time to proceed to completion So it is also necessary to provide residence time in the System. Although 
 this can be accomplished by use of long loops of pipe or tubing, the risk of catalyst precursor Settling out during 
 unavoidable outages in catalyst feed and the high preSSure 
 drop that this will cause makes this highly impractical. 
 Instead, the process of the invention is preferably carried out utilizing residence time pots designed to promote plug flow while retaining the catalyst Slurry in Suspension. 
 The design of the residence time pot is such that it will promote uniform (or close to uniform) residence times as well as constant temperature. Since plug flow is desired, designs which promote back mixing are definitely not pre 
 ferred. Although Some back mixing will naturally occur in tubing lines (due to Velocity gradients-a natural consequence of being totally in laminar flow), this is of relatively minor 
 impact. Axial mixing in the residence time pots is minimized by maintaining a high aspect ratio a preferred L/D (length 
 to diameter ratio) of about 10 to about 15). This results in a low velocity in the residence time pot and minimal back mixing due to Velocity gradients in laminar flow. 
 Some homogenization of the slurry occurs at the transi 
 tion Section from the residence time pot to the Smaller diameter feed lines. Additional radial mixing is preferably 
 provided by Small impellers, which are located near the US 6,617.405 B1 
 7 
 bottom of the residence time pot. The impeller promotes Some radial mixing, but mainly assures that the bottom Section of the residence time pot does not experience SuS pended solid buildup. 
 After activator has been added to the catalyst precursor Slurry in one or two steps, additional activator is added as a last step prior to entry into the reactor. Preferably, this 
 addition occurs within 30 minutes and preferably within less than 15 minutes of actual injection of the catalyst precursor 
 Slurry into the reactor. The activator can be in Solution in an inert Solvent (Such as a high Viscosity fluid carrier or a lower Viscosity Solvent) or added as pure component. It is essential 
 that a mixer, preferably an additional Static mixer element, be located immediately downstream of the addition point of 
 the additional activator. It is also important to keep the Slurry flowing to assure that no plugs form in the catalyst feed line. 
 Additional activator is fed to provide for sufficient activation of the catalyst plus a Small additional amount to Scavenge 
 impurities in the polymerization reactor. The total amount of 
 this additional “topping off activator can be about 0.1 to 
 about 75 percent by mol of the total amount of the activator 
 used for the activation of the precursor. Addition of all of the activator to the catalyst precursor eliminates mass transfer problems, which would prevent the activator from reaching the catalyst precursor if Separate addition to the reactor was 
 practiced. This practice leads to extremely efficient utiliza tion of activator and improved polymer product properties. 
 After completion of the mixing of activator with catalyst 
 precursor, direct injection into the reactor occurs. Means of feeding a slurry to a gas phase reactor are well known and described in the art (see European Patent Application 635 521, for example). 
 The hydrocarbon used for the formation of the slurry can 
 be any essentially air and moisture free aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon which is unreactive with the catalyst precursor, 
 the precursor activator compounds, and the cocatalyst. In 
 practice, Since many of the final polymer products find end 
 uses in food packaging, aromatic hydrocarbons would not be a preferred slurry solvent. The hydrocarbon slurry solvent is 
 typically chosen from hydrogenated “mineral oils” or naph 
 thenic oils of relatively high Viscosity to minimize Settling of 
 catalyst Solids in feed tubes and the like, although, with appropriate engineering design, lower Viscosity Solvents 
 Such as isopentane, hexane, and heptane can be used as Slurry Solvents. These are not particularly preferred due to 
 the additional complexity introduced by use of a lower Viscosity and more easily Settled slurry as catalyst. The 
 viscosity of the hydrocarbon slurry solvent, however, is sufficiently low so that the slurry can be conveniently pumped through the pre-activation apparatus and eventually 
 into the polymerization reactor. Preferred Solvents are ali phatic hydrocarbons with viscosity greater than about 50 centipoises (cps), particularly greater than about 100 cps and 
 less than about 5,000 cps. Particularly preferred solvents are 
 napthenic mineral oils typified by materials Such as the Kaydol series of food grade mineral oils supplied by Witco 
 under the trademark Kaydol(R) 350 and 550. 
 It is preferred not to use a Support. However, in those 
 cases where it is desired to Support the precursor, Silica is the preferred Support. Other Suitable Supports are inorganic 
 oxides Such as aluminum phosphate, alumina, Silica/alumina mixtures, Silica modified with an organoaluminum com pound Such as triethylaluminum, and Silica modified with diethyl Zinc. A typical Support is a Solid, particulate, porous 
 material essentially inert to the polymerization. It is used as a dry powder having an average particle Size of about 10 to 
 about 250 microns and preferably about 30 to about 100 15

 microns, a Surface area of at least 200 Square meters per gram and preferably at least about 250 Square meters per 
 gram; and a pore Size of at least about 100 angstroms and preferably at least about 200 angstroms. Generally, the 
 amount of support used is that which will provide about 0.1 
 to about 1.0 millimole of titanium per gram of Support and 
 preferably about 0.4 to about 0.9 millimole of titanium per gram of Support. Impregnation of the above mentioned catalyst precursor into a Silica Support can be accomplished 
 by mixing the precursor and Silica gel in the electron donor 
 solvent or other solvent followed by solvent removal under reduced pressure. The resultant Solid catalyst is then con verted into a free flowing Slurry with an aliphatic hydrocar 
 bon as described above Such that it is pumpable as a liquid into the process. Catalyst precursorS Such as those described 
 in U.S. Pat. No. 5,290,745 and European Patent Application 771 820 are particularly useful in the process of subject 
 invention when placed into a hydrocarbon Slurry in the 
 unactivated State. 
 The polymerization is conducted in the gas phase using a 
 continuous fluidized bed process. 
 Melt index is determined under ASTM D-1238, Condition E. It is measured at 190° C. and 2.16 kilograms and reported as grams per 10 minutes or decigrams per minute. Flow 
 index is determined under ASTM D-1238, Condition F. It is 
 measured at 190° C. and 10 times the weight used in determining the melt index, and reported as grams per 10 
 minutes or decigrams per minute. Melt flow ratio is the ratio 
 of flow index to melt index. The product, as removed from 
 the reactor, can have a melt indeX in the range of about 0.02 to about 300 grams per 10 minutes, and preferably has a melt 
 index in the range of about >0.04 to about 50 grams per 10 
 minutes. The melt flow ratio is in the range of about 20 to about 50, and is preferably in the range of about 20 to about 30. The density of the polymer is normally at least 0.900 
 gram per cubic centimeter, and is preferably in the range of 
 0.915 to 0.960 gram per cubic centimeter. The bulk density 
 can be in the range of about 18 to about 32 pounds per cubic foot, and is preferably greater than 22 pounds per cubic foot. 
 The molecular weight distribution of the polymer is reflected 
 in an Mw/Mn of about 3 to about 7. Mw is the weight average molecular weight, Mn is the number average 
 molecular weight; and the Mw/Mn ratio can be referred to as the polydispersity index, which is a measure of the 
 breadth of the molecular weight distribution. Mw/Mn can 
 also be related to MFR, with lower values of MFR indicated 
 lower values of Mw/Mn and a narrower molecular weight 
 distribution. 
 The transition metal based catalyst System including the activated precursor, ethylene, and, optionally, alpha-olefin 
 and hydrogen are continuously fed into the reactor, and the 
 final product is continuously removed from the reactor. 
 In the reactor: 
 The mole ratio of alpha-olefin (if used) to ethylene can be in the range of about 0.01:1 to about 0.8:1, and is preferably 
 in the range of about 0.02:1 to about 0.35:1. The mole ratio of hydrogen (if used) to ethylene can be in the range of about 
 0.001:1 to about 2:1, and is preferably in the range of about 0.01 to about 0.5:1. Preferred operating temperatures vary 
 depending on the density desired, i.e., lower temperatures 
 for lower densities and higher temperatures for higher 
 densities. 
 The pressure, i.e., the total pressure in the reactor, can be in the range of about 200 to about 500 psig (pounds per Square inch gauge) and is preferably in the range of about 
 280 to about 450 psig. The ethylene partial pressure can be US 6,617.405 B1 
 9 
 in the range of about 10 to about 150 psig, and is preferably 
 in the range of about >20 to about 120 psig. The balance of the total pressure is provided by alpha-olefin (if used) and an 
 inert gas Such as nitrogen. Other inert hydrocarbons, Such as an induced condensing agent e.g., isopentane, hexane also 
 contribute to the overall preSSure in the reactor according to their vapor pressure under the temperature and pressure 
 experienced in the reactor. A typical fluidized bed reactor 
 can be described as follows: 
 The bed is usually made up of the same granular resin that 
 is to be produced in the reactor. Thus, during the course of the polymerization, the bed comprises formed polymer particles, growing polymer particles, and catalyst particles 
 fluidized by polymerization and modifying gaseous compo 
 nents introduced at a flow rate or Velocity Sufficient to cause the particles to Separate and act as a fluid. The fluidizing gas 
 is made up of the initial feed, make-up feed, and cycle 
 (recycle) gas, i.e., comonomers and, if desired, modifiers and/or an inert carrier gas. 
 The essential parts of the reaction System are the vessel, 
 the bed, the gas distribution plate, inlet and outlet piping, a compressor, cycle gas cooler, and a product discharge SyS 
 tem. In the vessel, above the bed, there is a velocity 
 reduction Zone, and, in the bed, a reaction Zone. Both are above the gas distribution plate. 
 A typical fluidized bed reactor is further described in U.S. 
 Pat. No. 4,482,687. 
 The gaseous feed Streams of ethylene, other gaseous alpha-olefins (if used), and hydrogen (if used) are preferably fed to the reactor recycle line as well as liquid alpha-olefins (if used). The activated catalyst precursor is preferably 
 injected into the fluidized bed as a Solid or a mineral oil Slurry. The product composition can be varied by changing 
 the molar ratioS of the comonomers introduced into the 
 fluidized bed. The product is continuously discharged in 
 granular or particulate form from the reactor as the bed level builds up with polymerization. The production rate is con 
 trolled by adjusting the catalyst feed rate and/or the ethylene partial pressures. 
 The hydrogen:ethylene mole ratio can be adjusted to control average molecular weights. The alpha-olefins (other than ethylene) can be present in a total amount of up to 15 percent by weight of the copolymer and, if used, are pref 
 erably included in the copolymer in a total amount of about 1 to about 10 percent by weight based on the weight of the copolymer. 
 The residence time of the mixture of reactants including gaseous and liquid reactants, catalyst, and resin in the 
 fluidized bed can be in the range of about 1 to about 12 hours and is preferably in the range of about 2 to about 5 hours. 
 The reactor can be run in the condensing mode, if desired. 
 The condensing mode is described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,543, 
 399; 4,588,790; and 5,352,749. 
 The resin can be extruded in a conventional extruder 
 adapted for that purpose. Extruders and processes for extru 
 Sion are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,814, 135; 4,857,600; 
 5,076,988; and 5,153,382. Examples of various extruders, which can be used in forming film are a single Screw type 
 Such as one modified with a blown film die and air ring and continuous take off equipment, a blown film extruder, and a Slot cast extruder. A typical Single Screw type extruder can be described as one having a hopper at its upstream end and 
 a die at its downstream end. The hopper feeds into a barrel, 
 which contains a Screw. At the downstream end, between the 
 end of the Screw and the die, is a Screen pack and a breaker plate. The screw portion of the extruder is considered to be 15

 divided up into three Sections, the feed Section, the com pression Section, and the metering Section, and multiple 
 heating Zones from the rear heating Zone to the front heating 
 Zone, the multiple Sections and Zones running from upstream 
 to downstream. If it has more than one barrel, the barrels are 
 connected in Series. The length to diameter ratio of each barrel is in the range of about 16:1 to about 30:1. The extrusion can take place at temperatures in the range of 
 about 160 to about 270 degrees C., and is preferably carried 
 out at temperatures in the range of about 180 to about 240 degrees C. 
 The advantages of the invention are found in that molecu 
 lar weight distribution can be narrowed and hexane extract 
 ables can be decreased without a decrease in hydrogen response and catalyst activity; there is no rapid increase in 
 reaction rate, which can result in sheeting, chunking, and cessation of operation; reduction of the cocatalyst, i.e., activator, requirement; improved proceSS control; the pre 
 cursor is leSS Sensitive to over-reduction; catalyst fines are all active So they are less likely to Segregate and migrate to 
 the reactor wall to form sheets, facilitates activator change where different products are desired; the process allows for 
 complete activation even where the activator has very low (or nil) vapor pressure Such as tri-n-hexyl aluminum; the 
 process allows the use of leSS expensive activatorS Such as triethylaluminum and triusobutylaluminum; eliminates the 
 need for Separate cocatalyst feed; although the proceSS is 
 primarily focused on higher molecular weight (and lower levels of low molecular weight species), narrow molecular weight distribution products for fabrication into film, the process has broader application to higher melt indeX products, typically resins used in injection molding, elimi 
 nates other forms of catalyst premixing, often a unit opera tion; and allows for quick changes of catalyst by changing 
 relative flow rates of precursor and activator. 
 Conventional additives, which can be introduced into the resin product, are exemplified by antioxidants, ultraViolet absorbers, pigments, dyes, nucleating agents, fillers, Slip 
 agents, fire retardants, plasticizers, processing aids, 
 lubricants, Stabilizers, Smoke inhibitors, Viscosity control agents, and crosslinking agents, catalysts, and boosters, 
 tackifiers, and anti-blocking agents. Aside from the fillers, 
 the additives can be present in the blend in amounts of about 0.1 to about 10 parts by weight of additive for each 100 parts 
 by weight of polymer blend. Fillers can be added in amounts up to 200 parts by weight and more for each 100 parts by 
 weight of the blend. 
 Patents, patent applications, and other publications men 
 tioned in this specification are incorporated by reference 
 herein. 
 Molecular weights are weight average molecular weights 
 unless otherwise noted. 
 The invention is illustrated by the following examples. 
 EXAMPLES 1 to 4 
 Examples 1 to 4 are embodiments of the invention. In these examples, a Small polymerization reaction System, as 
 described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,290,745 and references con 
 tained therein, is used. Instead of manipulating the activator/ 
 electron donor ratioS in an in-line fashion as indicated in the 
 discussion of the preferred mode, the partially activated precursors are prepared in a batch fashion due to the extreme difficulty encountered in metering activator compound flows 
 which would be at rates of about 1 to 3 cubic centimeters per 
 hour. These results are illustrative of the effect of the 
 invention in manipulating polymer properties in an in-line US 6,617.405 B1 
 11 
 fashion over a larger range of polymer MFR (melt flow ratio), hexane extractables, and polymer bulk density. The Smaller reaction System is used illustratively to avoid experi 
 mentation in large commercial equipment, which can result in large amounts of off-specification polymer during the 
 experiment. The results described below, however, are directly Scalable to large Scale commercial reaction Systems. 
 Note: ratioS are mole ratioS unless otherwise Stated. 
 Catalyst Precursor Preparation 
 A titanium trichloride containing catalyst precursor is 
 prepared in a 1900 liter vessel equipped with pressure and temperature controls and a turbine agitator. A nitrogen 
 atmosphere (less than 5 ppm H2O) is maintained at all times. 1480 liters of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (THF, the internal 
 electron donor) containing less than 40 ppm H2O are added to the vessel. The THF is heated to a temperature of 50 degrees C., and 1.7 kilograms of granular magnesium metal 
 (70.9 gram atoms) are added, followed by 27.2 kilograms of titanium tetrachloride (137 mols). The magnesium metal has a particle size in the range of from 0.1 to 4 millimeters. The 
 titanium tetrachloride is added over a period of about 
 one-half hour. 
 The mixture is continuously agitated. The exotherm 
 resulting from the addition of titanium tetrachloride causes the temperature of the mixture to rise to approximately 72 
 degrees C. Over a period of about three hours. The tempera 
 ture is held at about 70 degrees C. by heating for approxi 
 mately another four hours. At the end of this time, 61.7 kilograms of magnesium dichloride (540 moles) are added and heating is continued at 70 degrees C. for another eight 
 hours. The mixture (solution) is then filtered through a 100 micron filter to remove undissolved magnesium dichloride and unreacted magnesium (less than 0.5 percent by weight). 
 100 kilograms of fumed Silica having a particle Size in the 
 range of from 0.1 to 1 microns are added to the mixture prepared above over a period of about two hours. The 
 mixture is stirred by means of a turbine agitator during this 
 time and for Several hours thereafter to thoroughly disperse 
 the Silica in the Solution. The temperature of the mixture is held at 70 degrees C. throughout this period and a nitrogen 
 atmosphere is maintained at all times. 
 The resulting Slurry is spray dried using an 8-foot diam 
 eter closed cycle spray dryer equipped with a rotary atom izer. The rotary atomizer is adjusted to give catalyst particles 
 with a D50 of 18 microns. The scrubber section of the spray dryer is maintained at approximately minus 4 degrees C. 
 Nitrogen gas is introduced into the Spray dryer at an inlet 
 temperature of 165 degrees C. and is circulated at a rate of approximately 1700 kilograms per hour. The catalyst Slurry 
 is fed to the Spray dryer at a temperature of about 35 degrees 
 C. and a rate of 90 to 95 kilograms per hour, or sufficient to yield an outlet gas temperature of approximately 125 
 degrees C. The atomization pressure is slightly above atmo Spheric. Discrete Spray dried catalyst precursor particles are 
 formed. 
 The Spray dried catalyst precursor contains 2.5 weight percent Ti, 6.3 weight percent Mg, and 25 to 29 weight 
 percent THF. The particles have a D50 of 14 microns and a span (D90-D10)/D50 ranging from 0.75 to 1.25 as deter mined by means of a Leeds and Northrup Microtrac(R) particle size analyzer using a dodecane Solvent, The discrete 
 catalyst precursor particles are mixed with mineral oil under 
 a nitrogen atmosphere in a 400 liter vessel equipped with a turbine agitator to form a slurry containing approximately 28 
 weight percent of the Solid catalyst precursor. 15

 To partially activate the catalyst Slurry, a 50 weight 
 percent solution of tri-n-hexylaluminum (TnHAI) in mineral 
 oil is added to the slurry followed by mixing for approxi 
 mately 72 hour. The TnHAI solution is employed in an 
 amount sufficient to provide 0.20 mole of TnHAI per mole of THF in the catalyst. Sequentially, then a 30 weight 
 percent solution of diethylaluminum chloride (DEAC) in 
 mineral oil is added and the mixture is mixed and held for 
 approximately 1 hour. The DEAC is employed in an amount 
 sufficient to provide 0.45 mole of DEAC per mole of THF 
 in the catalyst. The mole ratio of total activator (TnHAI plus 
 DEAC) to THF is 0.65:1. 
 Ethylene is copolymerized with 1-butene in a fluidized 
 bed reactor as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,349,648. Each polymerization is continuously conducted after equilibrium 
 is reached under conditions set forth in Table I. Polymer 
 ization is initiated in the reactor by continuously feeding the 
 above preactivated catalyst precursor into a fluidized bed of 
 polyethylene granules together with ethylene, 1-hexene, and 
 hydrogen. In example 1, an activator (in this case, a 
 cocatalyst) is dissolved in isopentane (iC5) and fed to reactor Separately from the preactivated catalyst. 
 Example 1 is repeated in examples 2 to 4 with the 
 exception that the activator is now admixed with the catalyst 
 in a final Step prior to addition to the reactor. Preactivated 
 catalyst and triethylaluminum activator are mixed in-line for 
 approximately 1 to 1.5 minutes. No external activator is fed 
 to the reactor. The reaction conditions are set forth in Table 
 I. The MFR and the bulk density are shown in Table II. It 
 will be noted that the MFR and bulk density of the blend 
 change with changes in the total activator/electron donor 
 mole ratio with little change in other polymer properties or 
 reaction conditions. Although the change in MFR is Small, 
 changes of this kind can have significant effects on end use 
 properties as indicated in U.S. Pat. No. 4,349,648, men 
 tioned above. The change in Settled bulk density is greater with the highest bulk density (example 4) occurring at the 
 lowest total activator/electron donor mole ratio.

 EXAMPLES 5 to 9 
 Examples 5 to 9 are also embodimets of the invention. Catalyst is prepared as in Example 1. The Same reaction 
 System is used. In these examples, however, 1-hexene is used as comonomer and trimethylaluminum as activator. In the control (example 5), the activator (cocatalyst) is fed Separately to the fluidized bed as a Solution in isopentane. 15 14 
 U.S. Pat. No. 5,068,489 is used in Comparative Examples 1, 
 3, 5, and 6. In the examples using a Silica impregnated 
 catalyst, the catalyst is introduced to the reactor as a dry 
 powder. In Comparative Examples 2, 4, 7, and 8, the catalyst 
 is fed to the reactor as a slurry. In these examples, the 
 activator (cocatalyst) is fed separately to the polymerizing 
 bed. The spray dried slurry fed catalyst of Comparative 
 Examples 2, 4, 7, and 8 is normally of higher productivity 
 and hence lower residual titanium level than the Silica 
 impregnated catalyst. This is illustrated by comparing Com 
 parative Examples 1 and 2. Note, that despite Similar reac 
 tion conditions, much higher residual titanium levels are 
 observed at these low activator:Timolar ratios, even though 
 the activator:ED molar ratios are much higher than those in Examples 1 to 9 illustrating the invention; also note the 
 substantially lower residual titanium for the catalysts of the 
 invention. Thus, a much more efficacious use of cocatalyst 
 activator is achieved by the process of the invention, as well 
 0 as achieving the same results in terms of reduced MFR i.e., 
 narrower molecular weight distribution (MWD) and lower hexane extractables. Both catalyst productivity and activa 
 tor utilization effectiveneSS are improved through addition of 
 the activator directly with the activated catalyst precursor composition in a hydrocarbon slurry.

 Examples 6 to 9 utilize activator mixed directly with the 
 preactivated catalyst in-line prior to introduction to the TABLE IV reactor. Since all of these examples use trimethylaluminum as activator, the effect of the invention on MFR is more 55 - Examples 
 difficult to ascertain Since this particular activator normally 
 gives low MFR values under any set of circumstances. The 
 effect on bulk density, however, is still clear as is the relatively high catalyst productivity observed, even at very 
 low Al/Tilevels. Variables and results can be found in Tables 
 III and IV.

 BACKGROUND 
 The present invention relates to a method for poly merizing alpha-olefins, a catalyst for such a polymeriza

 DETALED OESCRIPTION 
 In accordance with an aspect of the present inven tion, supported titanium is incorporated onto a suitable support by impregnating this support with reactive magnesium and utilizing this supported reactive magne 
 sium to react with tetravalent titanium (i.e., titanium in the plus 4 valence state) in a liquid medium. Unreacted titanium is soluble in this liquid medium, while reacted titanium and supported reactive magnesium are insolu 
 ble in this liquid medium. As used herein, the concept of supporting a material 
 on a carrier is intended to connote the incorporation of material (e.g., magnesium compositions and/or titan tium compositions) onto the carrier by physical or chemical means. Accordingly, supported material need not necessarily be chemically bound to the carrier. Catalysts produced according to aspects of the pres 
 ent invention may be described in terms of the manner in which they can be made. More particularly, these catalysts can be described in terms of the manner in which a suitable carrier may be treated in order to form such catalysts. 
 Suitable carrier materials which may be treated in clude solid, porous carrier materials such as silica, alu mina and combinations thereof. Such carrier materials 
 may be amorphous or crystalline in form. These carriers may be in the form of particles having a particle size of 
 from about 0.1 micron to about 200 microns, more pref erably from about 10 to about 80 microns. Preferably, the carrier is in the form of spherical particles, e.g., spray dried silica. The internal porosity of these carriers may be larger than 0.2 cm/gm, e.g., larger than about 0.6 cm/g. The specific surface area of these carriers may be larger than about 50 m2/g, e.g., from about 150 to about 1500 m2/g. It is desirable to remove physically bound water from the carrier material prior to contacting this material with water-reactive magnesium compounds. This water removal may be accomplished by heating the carrier 
 material to a temperature from about 100° C. to an upper limit of temperature represented by the tempera 
 ture at which change of state or sintering occurs. A suitable range of temperatures may, thus, be from about 
 100° C. to about 800° C., e.g., from about 150° C. to 
 about 250 C. w 4,481,301 5 Chemically bound water, as represented by a pres ence of OH groups in the carrier, may be present when the carrier is contacted with water-reactive magnesium compounds in accordance with an aspect of the present invention. This chemically bound water may be present as about 0.3 mmoles or more of OH groups per gram of carrier. Accordingly, an amount of, e.g., from about 0.5 to about 5 mmoles of OH groups per gram of carrier may be present, but a preferred range is from about 0.3 to about 0.7 mmoles of OH groups per gram of carrier. Excess OH groups present in the carrier may be re moved by heating the carrier for a sufficient time at a sufficient temperature to accomplish the desired re moval. More particularly, for example, a relatively small number of OH groups may be removed by suffi cient heating at from about 150 C. to about 250 C., whereas a relatively large number of OH groups may be removed by sufficient heating at at least 500 or 600 C., most especially, about from about 750° C. to about 850' C. The duration of heating may be overnight, e.g., 16 hours or a shorter period, e.g., at least 4 hours. The surface hydroxyl concentration of silica may be deter mined according to J. B. Peri and A. L. Hensley, Jr., J. Phys. Chem, 72 (8), 2926 (1968). While heating is a preferred means of removing OH groups inherently present in a carrier such as silica, other removal means are also possible such as chemical means. For example, a desired proportion of OH groups may be reacted with a chemical agent such as a hy droxyl reactive aluminum compound, e.g., triethylalu 
 Examples of suitable carrier materials are described in the Graff, U.S. Pat. No. 4,173,547. Note particularly the passage extending from column 3, line 62 to column 5, line 44 of this Graff patent. It is noted that internal porosity of carriers can be determined by a technique termed BET-technique, described by S. Brunauer, P. Emmett and E. Teller in Journal of the American Chemi cal Society, 60, pp. 209-319 (1938). Specific surface areas of carriers can also be measured in accordance with the above-mentioned BET-technique, with use of the stan dardized method as described in British Standards BS 
 4359, Volume 1, (1969). Further examples of carrier materials are given in the Stevens et al., U.S. Pat. No. 3,718,636. Note particularly the passage extending from line 12 to line 29 of column 3 of this Stevens etal patent. Also included as examples of carrier materials are polymeric silicas known as poly siloxanes. 
 An example of a preferred carrier is silica which has been dehydrated by fluidizing with nitrogen and heat 
 ing at about 800 C. for about 16 hours to achieve a surface hydroxyl concentration of about 0.5 mmols/g. The silica used may be a high surface area, amorphous silica (surface area=300 m2/g; pore volume of 1.65 cm3 per gram) marketed under the tradename Davison 952 by the Davison Division of W. R. Grace and Co. A suitable dehydrated carrier material may be further treated by impregnating same with a solid magnesium containing composition which is capable of reacting with a tetravalent titanium compound. One such mag nesium containing material is an organomagnesium composition of the formula RMgR'(2-m), where R and R"" are the same or different and represent stable organic moieties, provided that R' may also be halogen, and n is a rational number from about 0.5 to 2. A particular example of a solution of such an organomagnesium composition is a Grignard reagent, O

 2O.

 Grignard reagents are described in Organic Chemis 
 try, Second Edition, Morrison and Boyd, fifth printing, May 1968, pp. 112-114 and 516-521. Grignard reagents 
 are known to react with organic molecules or moieties which have hydrogen bonded directly to a nitrogen or 
 oxygen atom. Furthermore, Grignard reagents are also 
 known to react with organic molecules or moieties containing carbonyl groups, cyano groups and nitro 
 groups. Accordingly, stable organic moieties as defined 
 by R in the above-mentioned formula generally would not have any of the above-mentioned groups indicated as being reactive with Grignard reagents. Thus, exam 
 ples of R and R' include C1-C12 hydrocarbyl groups (e.g., C1-C12 alkyl or C6-C12 aryl) or C1-C12 alkoxy 
 groups, which may be unsubstituted or substituted, e.g., with one or more of halogen (e.g., F, Cl, Br or I), C1-C12 alkoxy, etc. A preferred composition according to the formula R,MgR'(2-) is ethylmagnesium chlo 
 ride. 
 It is noted that even a Grignard reagent of ethylmag nesium chloride may contain a mixture of molecules other than ethylmagnesium chloride, per se. For exam 
 ple, particularly under the influence of various liquids or solvent systems, ethylmagnesium chloride may dis proportionate to form essentially a mixture of magne 
 sium dichloride and diethylmagnesium. Such mixtures 
 are intended to be encompassed within the formula RMgR'2 in). Accordingly, it will be understood that compositions of the formula R,MgR'(2-m) and composi 
 tions representative thereof are intended herein to rep resent the overall empirical formula of these composi tions rather than to set forth the molecular formula of these compositions. Preferably, the carrier should be impregnated such that the pores of same contain reactive solid magnesium containing composition. A preferred means of accom 
 plishing this result is by incorporating a porous carrier 
 in a liquid medium containing a dissolved organomag 
 nesium composition of the formula R,MgR'(2-) and to cause magnesium to become impregnated into the pores 
 of the carrier by (1) a reaction of the organomagnesium composition with the carrier, by (2) a precipitation of magnesium from the organomagnesium composition 
 onto the carrier or by (3) a combination of such reaction and precipitation. Organo-magnesium compositions corresponding to 
 those found in Grignard reagents have the formula 
 RMgX, where R is as defined hereinabove and X is halogen, (e.g., Cl, Br or I), and are soluble in ethers. . Examples of such ethers are mentioned on column 4, lines 32-49 of the Yamaguchi et al. U.S. Pat. No. 3,989,881 and include aliphatic ethers, such as diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether, dibutyl ether, dipentyl ether 
 and ethyl-n-butyl ether and cyclic ethers such as tetra hydrofuran and dioxane. It has been theorized that the reason for the ability of such ethers (e.g., diethyl ether to solubilize such organomagnesium compositions (e.g., 
 65 C2H5MgCl) is by virtue of the ability of the magnesium 
 atom to act as a Lewis acid and to associate with at least one electron pair from the etheric oxygen which acts as a Lewis base. Such an association is represented as 
 follows: 4,481,301 
 C2H5 
 O 
 Although organomagnesium compounds of the for 
 mula RMgX tend to be insoluble in non-Lewis base solvents such as hexane, these organomagnesium com pounds may be completely soluble in mixed solvent systems such as hexane/tetrahydrofuran, provided that 
 a sufficient solubilizing amount of the Lewis base sol vent is present. Thus, according to one aspect of the present invention, a carrier may be slurried in a non Lewis base co-solvent and an organomagnesium com pound may be added thereto in the form of an ether solution thereof. Examples of non-Lewis base co-sol vents are given in the passage extending from column 6, 
 line 61 to column 7, line 8 of the Graff U.S. Pat. No. 4,173,547. These co-solvents include straight or branched saturated aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as butanes, pentanes, hexanes, heptanes, or commonly available mixtures thereof, generally known as gasoline, kerosene, gas, oil or other petroleum fractions. Further, such co-solvents include cyclic hydrocarbons, such as cyclopentane, cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane, as well as aromatic hydrocarbons, such as benzene or halogen aromatic hydrocarbons such as chlorobenzene. It is noted that such co-solvents should preferably not con tain groups which are reactive with the organomag nesium composition. A preferred co-solvent is n-hex 
 2. According to another aspect of the present invention, carrier is impregnated with magnesium composition by suitably contacting this carrier with a liquid containing organomagnesium composition of the formula RMgR'2-) in a partially dissolved state. More partic ularly, the carrier may be slurried in one of the above exemplified non-Lewis base co-solvents, such as hex ane, and a solution of Grignard in ether may be added thereto, the amount of ether relative to the amount of co-solvent being sufficient to only partially solubilize the Grignard. The non-soluble portion of the Grignard 5

 Accordingly, it may be possible to incorporate a magnesium composition onto a carrier by reacting an organomagnesium composition with reactive OH 
 groups of the carrier. Another means of incorporating a magnesium com position onto a carrier is to precipitate magnesium from an organomagnesium composition from a liquid onto a carrier. This precipitation may take place by any possi ble convenient means including cooling of the solvent, using a sufficiently large amount of non-solvent in the initial slurry, adding non-solvent to the slurry or strip ping off solvent. In the case of a carrier slurry where the liquid medium is essentially a hexane/tetrahydrofuran solution of ethylmagnesium chloride, it is preferred to precipitate ethylmagnesium chloride onto the carrier by distillation of the solvent. In this regard, it is noted that tetrahydrofuran and hexane have nearly equivalent boiling points. Thus, it would be expected that during the course of distilling these solvents, the ratio of tetra hydrofuran to hexane in the liquid state would remain essentially constant. On the other hand, if the boiling point of the co-solvent is significantly greater than the boiling point of the ether, then the relative concentra tion of co-solvent may increase appreciably as the distill lation proceeds. In such a case, a non-uniform precipita tion of magnesium may occur, such that any magnesium dihalide which is present tends to precipitate before organomagnesium is precipitated. Particularly in view of the above discussion, it will be understood that at least three possible types of sup ported magnesium compositions can be obtained. The first type is essentially a reaction product of an or ganomagnesium composition with a carrier having OH functionalities which are reactive with this organomag nesium composition. This product would contain essen tially no precipitated organomagnesium composition. 
 40 Examples of such reaction products are given in the 
 may be in the form of dihalomagnesium, the amount of 45 this non-soluble dihalomagnesium being essentially equivalent to an amount of dialkylmagnesium remaining 
 soluble in the solvent/co-solvent mixture. It is noted that if the organomagnesium compound is only sparingly soluble, e.g., to the extent of even l per cent or less, reactive organomagnesium which is con sumed by reactive sites on the carrier will be replaced by further dissolution of undissolved organomagnesium by a mass action effect. Another example of a means of impregnating is to slurry the carrier in a Lewis base solvent such as an ether and to add a solution of organomagnesium in ether to this slurry, the addition of organomagnesi 
 um/ether solution to ether or co-solvent/carrier slurry may take place as a gradual continuous dropwise addi tion while the liquid medium of the slurry is maintained under reflux conditions. Upon such addition, dissolved organomagnesium composition may react with the car rier at the site of reactive OH groups, if any, appearing on the available surface area of the carrier. Such a reac tion may be demonstrated with respect to ethylmag 
 nesium chloride as follows: 50 
 55 
 65 aforementioned Stevens et al U.S. Pat. No. 3,787,384 
 and Strobel et al U.S. Pat. No. 4,148,754. A second type of product is essentially an or ganomagnesium composition supported on a carrier. This product would contain essentially no reaction product of organomagnesium with the carrier. Such a product could result when an organomagnesium com position is precipitated onto a carrier having essentially no OH functionalities reactive with the organomag nesium composition. A third type of product contains both reacted or ganomagnesium composition and precipitated or ganomagnesium composition. Such a product could result when an excess of organomagnesium is precipi tated in the presence of a carrier containing reactive OH 
 functionalities. Accordingly, magnesium may be incorporated onto a 
 carrier in either an unreacted form or in a reacted form, this reaction taking place between reactive hydroxyl groups of the carrier and an organomagnesium compo sition. The molar ratio of organomagnesium composi tion used to impregnate the carrier with respect to the hydroxyl groups of the carrier may be, e.g., from about 0.5 to about 3. When an excess of organomagnesium is used, this ratio may be, e.g., from about 1.1 to about 2.5. Whether magnesium is in the form of a reaction prod 
 uct with the carrier or in the form of a non-reacted precipitate, it is noted that this supported magnesium 4,481,301 
 may, optionally, be in the form of a complex with one or more electron donating agents (i.e. Lewis bases). More particularly, when ethylmagnesium chloride is precipi tated from a hexane/tetrahydrofuran solution, each mole of ethylmagnesium chloride precipitated may be complexed with approximately one mole of tetrahydro furan. In more general terms, when an organomag nesium composition is precipitated from a solution con taining an ether, the resulting precipitate may have molecules of this ether complexed with molecules of the organomagnesium composition. The amount of magnesium composition which is impregnated onto the carrier should be sufficient to react with tetravalent titanium in order to incorporate a catalytically effective amount of titanium on the carrier in the manner set forth hereinbelow. More particularly, for example, from about 0.1 to about 5 or even 50 mmoles of magnesium may be impregnated per gram of carrier initially present. When a liquid containing an organomagnesium composition is contacted with a car rier the amount of magnesium in this liquid in terms of mmoles may be essentially the same as that stated above with respect to that which is impregnated onto the 
 carrier. 
 When a non-Lewis base co-solvent is used to slurry the carrier, an amount of such co-solvent sufficient to slurry such carrier may be used. More particularly, for 
 example, from about 2 to about 100 mls of such co-sol vent may be present per gram of carrier. A preferred 
 narrower range would be from about 5 to about 15 mls of co-solvent per gram of carrier. The amount and concentration of organomagnesi um/ether solution which is added to the co-solvent/car rier slurry are preferably sufficient to assure that the organomagnesium composition is at least partially solu 
 ble in the co-solvent/solvent system. Thus, this amount is dependent upon many factors such as the composition of solvents and organomagnesium, the temperature of 
 the co-solvent/solvent system, etc. However, it will be readily understood that the selection of proper amounts and concentrations of organomagnesium/ether solu tions is well within the ability of those of ordinary skill in the art. More particularly, for example, when an ethylmagnesium chloride/tetrahydrofuran solution is 
 added to a hexane/carrier slurry, the concentration of the ethylmagnesium chloride/tetrahydrofuran solution 
 may be from about 0.1 to about 10 Molar. A preferred narrower range would be from about 1 to about 3 Mo 
 lar. For example, when 107 g of silicic acid are suspended in 500 ml of n-heptane and 342 ml of a solution of 172 mmols of n-propyl magnesium chloride in diethyl ether are added thereto in accordance with Example 1 of the Strobel et al U.S. Pat. No. 4,148,754, the n-propyl mag nesium chloride may well be totally soluble in the n heptane/diethyl ether mixture. However, when 15 g of silica are slurried in 200 ml of n-hexane and 50 ml of a 2.0 molar solution of ethylmagnesium chloride in tetra hydrofuran is added thereto in accordance with Exam ple 1 given herein, infra, the ethylmagnesium chloride appears to be only partially soluble in the n-hexane/tet rahydrofuran mixture. While the above-exemplified methods of incorporat ing a solid reactive magnesium composition onto a car rier are preferred, it will be understood that alternative methods are available. For instance, it is possible to precipitate a dialkylmagnesium composition onto a car rier from a hydrocarbyl or halohydrocarbyl solvent 10

 containing essentially no ether. It is also possible to combine carrier and a solid organomagnesium composi 
 tion in the absence of a solvent by means of a ball mill ing device. However, such a ball milling process is less preferred, particularly because it does not tend to effec tively incorporate a reactive magnesium compound into 
 the pores of the carrier. It is particularly noted that mechanical shearing means such as ball milling are not necessary to achieve the desired impregnation of catalyst onto carrier in accordance with aspects of the present invention. Ac cordingly, a ball milling process such as described in 
 Examples 2-5 of the Grant U.S. Pat. No. 3,821,186 is unnecessary and may be avoided. Moreover, a ball milling process may tend to disrupt the particle size and morphology of the carrier. Since catalysts made in ac cordance with aspects of the present invention are pref erably capable of being used in gas phase, fluid bed polymerizations, e.g., as described in the Karol et al U.S. Pat. No. 4,302,566, the particle size and morphol ogy of the catalyst may be rather critical. Accordingly, another reason for avoiding ball milling is to preserve the particle size and morphology of the carrier while it is being treated in accordance with aspects of the pres 
 ent invention. The solid supported magnesium-containing composi tion is preferably in the form of a free-flowing powder 
 when dry. It is particularly noted that when a carrier is impregnated by many of the above-exemplified meth 
 ods neither the carrier nor the magnesium is contacted with either an organoaluminum compound or an alumi num halide compound. Thus, such a treatment with a significant amount of an organoaluminum compound or an aluminum halide compound is preferably not part of the present invention. A carrier treated with an organomagnesium composi tion according to the above-exemplified methods may 
 be reacted with a tetravalent titanium compound in a liquid medium. The tetravalent titanium compound is soluble in this liquid reaction medium, while the treated carrier, including the magnesium containing portion 
 thereof, is insoluble in this liquid reaction medium. Thus, the reaction which takes place between the tetra valent titanium and the reactive magnesium-containing composition is a reaction of a solid with a liquid. It is 
 further noted that the reacted titanium is insoluble in the 
 liquid reaction medium. The reaction which takes place between a solid, sup ported organomagnesium compound and tetravalent 
 titanium in the liquid reaction medium is felt to be essen tially an oxidation/reduction reaction, wherein the or ganomagnesium composition acts as a reducing agent 
 for the tetravalent titanium. On the other hand, while not wishing to be bound by any particular theory or 
 chemical mechanism, the reaction which takes place between (1) tetravalent titanium and (2) the reaction product of a Grignard reagent and carrier containing reactive OH groups is not felt to be an oxidation/reduc tion reaction. However, it is noted that both of the above-mentioned reactions lead to the incorporation of titanium onto a support corresponding to the treated 
 carrier. Examples of tetravalent titanium compounds, which may be used in the liquid reaction medium, are given in the passage extending from line 35 to line 54 of column 6 of the Graff U.S. Pat. No. 4,173,547. Such examples include titanium halides (e.g., where the halide portion thereof is C or Br), titanium alkoxides (e.g., where the 4,481,301 11 
 alkoxide portion thereof is a C1-C6 alkoxide), or mix tures thereof. A preferred tetravalent titanium com pound is TiCl4. It may also be possible to replace some or all of the above-mentioned tetravalent titanium compounds with one or more other transition metal compounds. Such other transition metal compounds are exemplified in the passage extending from line 55 to line 60 of column 6 of 
 the Graffetal U.S. Pat. No. 4,173,547. Preferred transi tion metal compounds include zirconium compounds (e.g., ZrCl4) and, especially, vanadium compounds (e.g., VCl3). The liquid portion of the liquid reaction medium is preferably a solution of the tetravalent titanium com pound in a solvent which may be one or more of the organic liquids exemplified hereinabove as being suit able for use as a co-solvent in the impregnation of the carrier with reactive magnesium composition. A pre 
 ferred solvent for the tetravalent titanium compound is n-heptane. 
 The reaction of the tetravalent titanium compound in the liquid medium conveniently takes place by slurrying 
 the solid carrier containing the reactive magnesium composition in a solution of the tetravalent titanium compound and heating the liquid reaction medium to a suitable reaction temperature, e.g., to the reflux temper ature of the solvent at standard atmospheric pressure. Thus, the reaction may take place under reflux condi 
 tions. 
 The various reaction parameters are subject to a wide variety of possibilities, suitable selection of such param eters being well within the skill of those having ordi nary skill in the art. However, for example, the volume of tetravalent titanium solution to treated carrier ini 
 tially slurried in the solution may be from about 0.1 to about 10 mls per gram of such carrier. The concentra tion of the tetravalent titanium solution may be, for example, from about 0.1 to about 5 Molar. The amount of tetravalent titanium in solution may be, e.g., in excess of the molar amount of organomagnesium earlier used to treat the carrier. More particularly, for example, the molar ratio of tetravalent titanium to organomagnesium may be from about 1 to about 10, more particularly from about 3 to about 6. These ratios given for tetrava lent titanium to organomagnesium are generally repre sentative of acceptable ratios for tetravalent titanium to measurable hydroxyl groups on the carrier. Unreacted titanium may be removed by suitable separation tech niques such as decantation, filtration and washing. The supported catalyst may be activated with suit 
 able activators. Such suitable activators include those organometallic compounds described in the passage 
 extending from column 4, line 45 to column 5, line 12 of 
 the Stevens et al U.S. Pat. No. 3,787,384 and in the passage extending from column 4, line 56 to column 5, 
 line 59 of the Strobel et al U.S. Pat. No. 4,148,754. A preferred activator is triethylaluminum. The catalyst may be activated in situ by adding the activator and catalyst separately to the polymerization 
 medium. It is also possible to combine the catalyst and activator before introduction into the polymerization medium, e.g., for up to about 2 hours at a temperature from about - 40' to about 80° C. Still other types of combinations of catalysts and activators are possible (note the passage extending from line 50 to line 60 in column 5 of the Stevens et al U.S. Pat. No. 3,787,384. A suitable activating amount of the activator may be used. The number of moles of activator per gram atom 5

 of titanium in the catalyst may be, e.g., from about 1 to about 100 and is preferably greater than about 5 (note the passage extending from column 5, line 71 to column 
 6, line 2 of the Stevens et al U.S. Pat. No. 3,787,384). Alpha-olefins may be polymerized with the catalysts prepared according to aspects of the present invention by any suitable process. Such processes include poly 
 merizations carried out in suspension, in solution or in the gas phase (note the passage extending from line 25 
 to line 31 in column 6 of the Strobel et al U.S. Pat. No. 
 4,148,754 and the passage extending from line 32 to line 
 49 in column 5 of the Stevens et all U.S. Pat. No. 
 3,787,384. Gas phase polymerizations are preferred 
 such as those taking place in stirred bed reactors and, especially, fluidized bed reactors. The molecular weight of the polymer may be con trolled in a known manner, preferably by using hydro gen. With the catalysts produced according to aspects 
 of the present invention, molecular weight may be suit ably controlled with hydrogen when the polymeriza tion is carried out at relatively low temperatures, e.g., 
 from about 30 to about 105 C. This control of molecu 
 lar weight may be evidenced by a measurable positive melt index for the polymer produced. The catalysts prepared according to aspects of the 
 present invention are highly active and may have an activity of at least about 5.8, e.g., from about 5.8 to about 11.6 in terms of grams of polymer produced per hour per mmole of Tiper kPa of ethylene pressure. The catalysts prepared according to aspects of the present invention are particularly useful for the produc tion of linear low density polyethylene polymers. Such linear low density polyethylene polymers may have a density of 0.94 g/cc or less, preferably 0.930 or less or even 0.925 g/cc or less. In accordance with certain aspects of the present invention, it is possible to achieve densities of less than 0.915 g/cc and even 0.900 g/cc or 
 less. Advantageous properties of linear low density poly 
 ethylene polymers are described in the Anderson et al U.S. Pat. No. 4,076,698. These linear low density poly ethylene polymers may be polymers of ethylene with one or more C3-C10 alpha-olefins. Thus, copolymers having two monomeric units are possible as well as terpolymers having three monomeric units. Particular examples of such polymers include ethylene/1-butene copolymers, ethylene/1-hexene copolymers, ethylene/4-methyl-1-pentene copolymers, ethylene/1- butene/1-hexene terpolymers, ethylene/propylene/1- hexene terpolymers and ethylene/propylene/1-butene terpolymers. When propylene is employed as a como nomer, the resulting linear low density polyethylene polymer preferably has at least one other alpha-olefin 
 comonomer having at least four carbon atoms in an amount of, e.g., at least 1 percent by weight of the poly mer. Accordingly, ethylene/propylene copolymers are possible, but not preferred. The linear low density polyethylene polymers pro 
 duced in accordance with certain aspects of the present invention preferably contain at least about 80 percent by weight of ethylene units. A particularly desirable method for producing linear low density. polyethylene polymers, according to an 
 aspect of the present invention, is felt to be via a fluid bed reactor. Such a reactor and means for operating 
 same is described in the Levine et al U.S. Pat. No. 
 4,011,382 or the Karoletal U.S. Pat. No. 4,302,566. The activity of the catalyst produced in accordance with 4,481,301 13 
 certain aspects of the present invention is felt to be sufficient to produce a linear low density polyethylene polymer which is an ethylene/1-hexene copolymer, e.g., having a density of less than 0.930 g/cc, in such a 
 fluid bed reactor. 
 As described in the Karol et al U.S. Pat. No. 4,302,566, a preferred process for conducting a gas phase, fluid bed polymerization is as follows. The polymerization reaction is conducted by contact ing a stream of the monomers, in a gas phase process, such as in the fluid bed process described below, and substantially in the absence of catalyst poisons such as moisture, oxygen, CO, CO2, and acetylene with a cata lytically effective amount of the completely activated catalyst at a temperature and at a pressure sufficient to 
 initiate the polymerization reaction. .:* In order to achieve the desired density ranges in th copolymers it is necessary to copolymerize enough of 
 the 2C3 comonomers with ethylene to achieve a level of >0 to 10 mol percent of the C3 to C8 comonomer in the copolymer. The amount of comonomer needed to achieve this result will depend on the particular comonomer(s) employed. In accordance with the invention, it has unexpectedly been found that using a gas phase catalytic polymeriza 
 tion reaction, 1-hexene (e.g. normal 1-hexene, and/or 4-methyl-1-pentene) can be incorporated into an ethyl ene polymer chain with high efficiency. In other words, a relatively small concentration of 1-hexene monomer in the gas phase reactor can lead to a relatively large incorporation of 1-hexene into the polymer. Thus, 1 hexene can be incorporated into an ethylene polymer chain in a gas phase reactor in amounts up to 20 percent by weight, preferably 5 to 11 percent by weight, to produce linear low density, polyethylene having a den sity of less than 0.930 g/cc. The reaction is preferably conducted in a fluid bed reactor using the catalyst ac cording to the invention prepared by impregnating a carrier with both reacted and precipitated magnesium being in excess of the number of moles of OH groups in the carrier, and then reacting this impregnated carrier with a titanium compound in molar excess with respect to supported magnesium. This preferred process is most useful when polymers having a density of 0.920 g/cc are required. However, when higher densities are desired, it is possible to employ catalysts in which the only magne 
 sium present is reacted with the carrier (i.e. in the sub stantial absence of precipitated magnesium), and/or where the titanium compound is reacted with the sup ported magnesium composition in a molar ratio of one or less with the magnesium. 
 A fluidized bed reaction system which can be used in the practice of the process of the present invention is 
 illustrated in FIG. 1. With reference thereto the reactor 
 10 consists of a reaction zone 12 and a velocity reduc tion zone 14. 
 The reaction zone 12 comprises a bed of growing polymer particles, formed polymer particles and a minor amount of catalyst particles fluidized by the con tinuous flow of polymerizable and modifying gaseous components in the form of make-up feed and recycle gas through the reaction zone. To maintain a viable fluidized bed, the mass gas flow rate through the bed must be above the minimum flow required for fluidiza tion, and preferably from about 1.5 to about 10 times Gmrand more preferably from about 3 to about 6 times Gnf:Gmfis used in the accepted form as the abbrevia tion for the minimum mass gas flow required to achieve 10

 fluidization, C. Y. Wen and Y. H. Yu, ""Mechanics of Fluidization', Chemical Engineering Progress Sympo 
 sium Series, Vol. 62, p. 100-111 (1966). It is essential that the bed always contains particles to prevent the formation of localized ""hot spots' and to entrap and distribute the particulate catalyst throughout 
 the reaction zone. On start up, the reaction zone is usu ally charged with a base of particulate polymer particles before gas flow is initiated. Such particles may be identi cal in nature to the polymer to be formed or different therefrom. When different, they are withdrawn with the desired formed polymer particles as the first prod uct. Eventually, a fluidized bed of the desired polymer particles supplants the start-up bed. The partially or completely activated catalyst used in 
 the fluidized bed is preferably stored for service in a reservoir 32 under a blanket of a gas which is inert to the stored material, such as nitrogen or argon. Fluidization is achieved by a high rate of gas recycle to and through the bed, typically in the order of about 50 times the rate of feed of make-up gas. The fluidized bed has the general appearance of a dense mass of viable particles in possible free-vortex flow as created by the percolation of gas through the bed. The pressure drop through the bed is equal to or slightly greater than the 
 mass of the bed divided by the cross-sectional area. It is thus dependent on the geometry of the reactor. Make-up gas is fed to the bed at a rate equal to the rate at which particulate polymer product is with drawn. The composition of the make-up gas is deter mined by a gas analyzer 16 positioned above the bed. The gas analyzer determines the composition of the gas being recycled and the composition of the make-up gas is adjusted accordingly to maintain an essentially steady state gaseous composition within the reaction zone. : To insure complete fluidization, the recycle gas and, where desired, part of the make-up gas are returned to the reactor at point 18 below the bed. There exists a gas distribution plate 20 above the point of return to aid fluidizing in the bed. 
 The portion of the gas stream which does not reactin the bed constitutes the recycle gas which is removed from the polymerization zone, preferably by passing it 
 into a velocity reduction zone 14 above the bed where entrained particles are given an opportunity to drop 
 back into the bed. Particle return may be aided by a cyclone 22 which may be part of the velocity reduction zone or exterior thereto. Where desired, the recycle gas may then be passed through a filter 24 designed to re move small particles at high gas flow rates to prevent dust from contacting heat transfer surfaces and com pressor blades. The recycle gas is then compressed in a compressor 25 and then passed through a heat exchanger 26 wherein it is stripped of heat of reaction before it is returned to the bed. By constantly removing heat of reaction, no noticeable temperature gradient appears to exist within the upper portion of the bed. A temperature gradient will exist in the bottom of the bed in a layer of about 6 to 12 inches, between the temperature of the inlet gas and the temperature of the remainder of the bed. Thus, it has been observed that the bed acts to almost immediately adjust the temperature of the recy cle gas above this bottom layer of the bed zone to make it conform to the temperature of the remainder of the bed thereby maintaining itself at an essentially constant temperature under steady state conditions. The recycle 
 is then returned to the reactor at its base 18 and to the 4,481,301 15 
 fluidized bed through distribution plate 20. The com pressor 25 can also be placed upstream of the heat ex changer 26. The distribution plate 20 plays an important role in the operation of the reactor. The fluidized bed contains growing and formed particulate polymer particles as well as catalyst particles. As the polymer particles are hot and possibly active, they must be prevented from settling, for if a quiescent mass is allowed to exist, any active catalyst contained therein may continue to react and cause fusion. Diffusing recycle gas through the bed 
 at a rate sufficient to maintain fluidization at the base of the bed is, therefore, important. The distribution plate 20 serves this purpose and may be a screen, slotted plate, perforated plate, a plate of the bubble cap type, and the like. The elements of the plate may all be sta tionary, or the plate may be of the mobile type disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,298,792. Whatever its design, it must diffuse the recycle gas through the particles at the base of the bed to keep them in a fluidized condition, and also serve to support a quiescent bed of resin particles when the reactor is not in operation. The mobile elements of the plate may be used to dislodge any polymer particles entrapped in or on the plate. Hydrogen may be used as a chain transfer agent in the polymerization reaction of the present invention. The ratio of hydrogen/ethylene employed will vary be tween about 0 to about 2.0 moles of hydrogen per mole 
 of the monomer in the gas stream. Any gas inert to the catalyst and reactants can also be present in the gas stream. The activator compound is preferably added to the reaction system at the hottest portion of the gas which is usually downstream from heat exchanger 26. Thus, the activator may be fed into the gas recycle system from dispenser 27 thru line 27A. Compounds of the structure Zn(Ra)(R), wherein Ra and Rb are the same or different C to C14 aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon radicals, may be used in conjunc tion with hydrogen, with the catalysts of the present invention as molecular weight control or chain transfer agents, that is, to increase the melt index values of the copolymers that are produced. About 0 to 50, and pref. erably about 20 to 30, mols of the Zn compound (as Zn) would be used in the gas stream in the reactor per mol of titanium compound (as Ti) in the reactor. The zinc compound would be introduced into the reactor prefer ably in the form of a dilute solution (2 to 30 weight percent) in hydrocarbon solvent or absorbed on a solid diluent material, such as silica, of the types described above, in amounts of about 10 to 50 weight percent. These compositions tend to be pyrophoric. The zinc compound maybe added alone, or with any additional portions of the activator compound that are to be added to the reactor from a feeder, not shown, which could be positioned adjacent dispenser 27, near the hottest por tion of the gas recycle system. It is essential to operate the fluid bed reactor at a temperature below the sintering temperature of the polymer particles. To insure that sintering will not oc cur, operating temperatures below the sintering temper ature are desired. For the production of ethylene co polymers in the process of the present invention an operating temperature of about 30” to 115 C. is pre ferred, and a temperature of about 75"" to 95°C. is most preferred. Temperatures of about 75° to 90° C. are used to prepare products having a density of about 0.91 to 0.92, and temperatures of about 80' to 100° C. are used to prepare products having a density of about >0.92 to 10

 0.94, and temperatures of about 90 to 115 C. are used to prepare products having a density of about >0.94 to 
 0.96. The fluid bed reactor is operated at pressures of up to about 1000 psi, and is preferably operated at a pressure of from about 150 to 350 psi, with operation at the higher pressures in such ranges favoring heat transfer since an increase in pressure increases the unit volume heat capacity of the gas. The partially or completely activated catalyst in jected into the bed at a rate equal to its consumption at a point 30 which is above the distribution plate 20. In jecting the catalyst at a point above the distribution plate is an important feature of this invention. Since the catalysts used in the practice of this invention are highly active, injection of the fully activated catalyst into the area below the distribution plate may cause polymeriza tion to begin there and eventually cause plugging of the distribution plate. Injection into the viable bed, instead, aids in distributing the catalyst throughout the bed and tends to preclude the formation of localized spots of high catalyst concentration which may result in the formation of ""hot spots"". A gas which is inert to the catalyst such as nitrogen or argon is used to carry the partially or completely reduced precursor composition, and any additional activator compound or non-gaseous chain transfer 
 agent that is needed, into the bed. The production rate of the bed is controlled by the rate of catalyst injection. The production rate may be increased by simply increasing the rate of catalyst injec tion and decreased by reducing the rate of catalyst in jection. Since any change in the rate of catalyst injection will change the rate of generation of the heat of reaction, the temperature of the recycle gas is adjusted upwards or 
 downwards to accommodate the change in rate of heat generation. This insures the maintenance of an essen tially constant temperature in the bed. Complete instru mentation of both the fluidized bed and the recycle gas cooling system is, of course, necessary to detect any temperature change in the bed so as to enable the opera in the temperature of 
 the recycle gas. . . . "" Under a given set of operating conditions, the fluid ized bed is maintained at essentially a constant height by withdrawing a portion of the bed as product at a rate equal to the rate of formation of the particulate polymer product. Since the rate of heat generation is directly related to product formation, a measurement of the temperature rise of the gas across the reactor (the differ ence between inlet gas temperature and exit gas temper ature) is determinative of the rate of particulate polymer formation at a constant gas velocity. The particulate polymer product is preferably contin uously withdrawn at a point 34 at or close to the distri bution plate 20 and in suspension with a portion of the gas stream which is vented before the particulates settle to preclude further polymerization and sintering when the particles reach their ultimate collection zone. The suspending gas may also be used, as mentioned above, to drive the product of one reactor to another reactor. The particulate polymer product is conveniently and preferably withdrawn through the sequential operation of a pair of timed valves 36 and 38 defining a segrega tion zone 40. While valve 38 is closed, valve 36 is opened to emit a plug of gas and product to the zone 40 
 between it and valve 36 which is then closed. Valve 38 4,481,301 17 
 is then opened to deliver the product to an external recovery zone. Valve 38 is then closed to await the next product recovery operation. 
 Finally, the fluidized bed reactor is equipped with an adequate venting system to allow venting the bed dur 
 ing start up and shut down. The reactor does not re quire the use of stirring means and/or wall scraping 
 means. The highly active supported catalyst system of this invention appears to yield a fluid bed product having an average particle size between about 0.005 to about 0.07 inches and preferably about 0.02 to about 0.04 inches. The feed stream of gaseous monomer, with or with out inert gaseous diluents, is fed into the reactor at a space time yield of about 2 to 10 pounds/hour/cubic 
 foot of bed volume. 
 The term virgin resin or polymer as used herein means polymer, in granular form, as it is recovered from the polymerization reactor. Certain of the catalysts of the present invention are capable of producing low density. ethylene/hexene 
 copolymers in a gas phase, fluid bed reactor, which copolymers are capable of being formed into films hav ing especially desirable properties. More particularly, these catalysts are prepared by heating silica at a tem perature of at least 600 C., e.g., from about 750° C. to about 850 C., for a period of time sufficient to remove physically and chemically bound water on the silica to the extent that from about 0.3 to about 0.7 mmoles of OH groups are present per gram of silica. This silica is then slurried in a liquid medium and contacted with from about 1.1 to about 2.5 mmoles of a Grignard rea gent in this liquid medium for a time and temperature sufficient to permit dissolved organomagnesium to react with reactive OH groups on the silica. The liquid is then evaporated, and the resulting dry, free-flowing powder 
 is slurried in another liquid medium to be contacted with a tetravalent titanium compound, the number of moles of this tetravalent titanium compound being in excess of the number of moles of magnesium supported on the silica. For example, this molar ratio of tetravalent titanium to supported magnesium may be from about 3 
 to about 6. Films having especially desirable properties may be formed with the above-mentioned ethylene/hexene copolymers by a variety of techniques. For example, 
 desirable blown films as well as slot cast films may be formed. Blown films formed from ethylene/hexene copoly mers having a density from 0.920 to 0.927 g/cc may have especially desirable properties for bag structures. For example, such blown films may be fabricated into trash bag structures which, when loaded to capacity, resist breaking when dropped from a height of, e.g., four feet. A particular example of a blown film formed from an ethylene/hexene copolymer having a density of 
 0.927 and a melt index of 1 (ASTM D-1238, condition E), which is, in turn, formed in a gas phase, fluid bed reactor with a catalyst according to the present inven 
 tion, is a blown film having a thickness of 1 mil, a dart impact strength of at least 122g, an MD Elmendorf tear strength of at least 164 g/mil, a TD Elmendorf tear strength of at least 665 g/mil, a MD tensile strength of at least 6,400 lbs/in2 and a TD tensile strength of at least 5,400 lbs/in2. Slot cast films formed from low density ethylene/- hexene copolymers having a density of from about 0.916 to about 0.92 may have especially desirable prop 10

 erties as pallet stretch wrap. For example, such stretch wrap may hold loads together and onto pallets and resist breaking when subjected to forces encountered in loading operations where loads are moved about, dropped, etc. A particular example of a slot cast film formed from an ethylene/hexene copolymer having a 
 density of about 0.92 and a melt index of 1.7 (ASTM D-1238, condition E), which is, in turn, formed in a gas phase, fluid bed reactor with a catalyst according to the present invention, is a slot cast film having a thickness of 1 mil, an MD tensile strength of at least about 5,000 lbs/in, an ultimate elongation of at least 500 percent and a TD Elmendorf tear strength of at least 600 g/mil. The following Examples give examples of reactants and parameters which may be used in accordance with aspects of the present invention. 
 EXAMPLE 1. 
 All procedures were carried out in glass or quartz equipment under purified nitrogen using predried nitro 
 gen purged solvents. Davison silica gel, Grade 952, was dehydrated by fluidizing with nitrogen, heating at 200 C. for two hours and cooling to room temperature. This heated 
 silica is believed to contain about 3 mmoles of OH groups per gram of silica. 
 15g of this product was slurried in 200 ml n-hexane. A 2.0 molar solution of ethylmagnesium chloride in tetrahydrofuran (50 ml, 100 mmoles) was added drop wise to the refluxing slurry over approximately 20 min utes, after which time refluxing was continued for a further 30 minutes. The solvents were distilled off, giv ing 29.5g of dry free-flowing powder. 
 15g of this product (50.8 mmoles of Mg) was slurried in a 0.57 Molar solution of TiCl4 in heptane (150ml, 85.5 mmoles) and refluxed for 45 minutes, filtered, the solids washed with three 150 ml portions of hexane and dried under vacuum. The titanium content of this solid cata 
 lyst was 1.39 mmoles/g. 
 Slurry Polymerizations in n-Hexane

 To 1.0 liter of pure dry n-hexane at 30° C. was added a 1.52 M solution of triethylaluminum (1.90 ml, 2.89 mmoles), 1-butene (50 g, 0.89 moles), hydrogen (0.06 moles) and the above catalyst (0.079 g, 0.11 mmoles Ti) giving an Al/Ti ratio of 26. Ethylene addition was begun and polymerization conditions were adjusted to 80' C. and 120 psig total pressure. After 30 minutes, under these conditions, ethylene addition was stopped and the reactor cooled. Upon vacuum drying, a total of 195g of polymer with a melt index (MI, I2) of 53 and a density of 0.9166 g/cc was obtained. 
 2. Ethylene, 1-Hexene Copolymerization 
 The copolymerization was carried out as in 1 using 
 2.4 ml (3.65 mmoles) of TEAL, 91 g 1-hexene (1.08 moles), hydrogen (0.033 moles) and 0.079 g (0.11 mmoles Ti), giving an Al/Tiratio of 33. After drying, a . total of 150 g of polymer with a MI of 3.95 and a density 
 of 0.9187 g/cc was obtained. 
 COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE A 
 Several catalysts prepared substantially in accor 
 dance with the teachings of the Karoletal U.S. Pat. No. 4,302,566, were used in comparative testing as discussed in Examples given hereinafter. These catalysts prepared 4,481,301 19 
 substantially in accordance with this Karol et al patent are referred to herein as ""comparative A' catalysts or simply as 'A' catalysts. The comparative A catalysts are felt to be substan tially equivalent to the catalysts prepared according to 5 
 the Examples of the Karol et al patent. More particu larly, these catalysts are felt to be substantially equiva lent to those prepared by the following representative procedure. 
 In a 5 liter flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, 10 16.0 g (0.168 Mol) of anhydrous MgCl2 is mixed with 850 ml of pure tetrahydrofuran under nitrogen. The mixture is stirred at room temperature (~25 C.) while 13.05 g (0.069 Mol) of TiCl4 is added dropwise. After complete addition, the contents of the flask are heated 15 to reflux for about one-half to one hour to dissolve the 
 solids. The system is cooled to room temperature and 3 liters of pure n-hexane are slowly added over a period of one-half hour. A yellow solid precipitates. The super 
 natant is decanted and the solids are washed with 3X 20 
 one liter of n-hexane. The solids are filtered and dried in a rotating evaporating flask at 40°-60° C. to give 55g of solid precursor composition. The precursor composition may be analyzed at this 20 
 nitrogen line, and overhead stirrer. Under a slow nitro gen purge, 200 ml of dry hexane was added to the silica while stirring. The silica/hexane slurry was brought to reflux temperature and 50 ml of 2.0 M EtMgCL/THF 
 solution was added dropwise (about 15 minutes) and the 
 reflux was continued for an additional 30 minutes. After 
 this time, the solvents were removed by distillation and the silica dried at 80 C. under a nitrogen purge. Total yield, 29 grams; Mg (Theory) 3.45 mmols/gm. 
 Step B: 15 grams of Step A reaction product (51.7 mmols of Mg) were placed into a 500 ml reaction flask (apparatus as described above). 200 ml of n-heptane containing 10.0 
 ml (91 mmols) of TiCl4 was added to the flask while stirring. The slurry was refluxed for 45 minutes. After this time, the slurry was cooled to room temperature, transferred to a filter flask (under nitrogen), filtered, washed with four 100 ml portions of hexane and dried under nitrogen purge; Mg (found) 1.65 mmols/gm, Mg (Theory) 1.67; Ti (found) 1.24 mmols/gm. In addition, for comparison reasons, Example 5 was repeated with the molar ratio of TiCl4 added in Step B to the magnesium present on the silica being less than 1. The resultant catalyst and the processing details are point for Mg and Ti content since some of the Mgand- 25 indicated in Table I as Example 5 (Comparative).

 still exist in the form of the compounds in which they are first added to the electron donor compound and that all other residual weight in the precursor composition is due to the electron donor compound. Analysis of the solid would typically show the fol- 50 lowing percent by weight: Mg: 6.1 percent, Ti: 4.9 per cent; which corresponds to TiMg2.45Cl39(THF)70. - THF means tetrahydrofuran. . This precursor composition, which constitutes the catalytic portion of the comparative A catalyst, is sup- 55 
 ported on an inert silica carrier and activated in accor dance with the teachings of the Karol et al patent. 
 EXAMPLES 2-7 
 The catalysts of Examples 2-7 were prepared in two 60 steps and the details are summarized in Table I, herein below. The preparation of the catalyst of Example 2 is felt to be representative of the preparation of the cata lysts of Examples 3–7 and is described below: Step A: 65 
 15 grams of Davison silica gel (dried at 200° C. for 4 hours) were placed into a 500 ml 4-neck reaction flask fitted with a dropping funnel, water condensor, dry hexane and about 100 ml of 1-hexene (62.5gms) were added to the autoclave while at ambient temperature. 0.047 gms of catalyst (0.06 mmols of Ti) was slurried into about 50 ml of hexane to which was added suffi 
 cient triethyl aluminum to give an Al/Tiratio of 40. This catalyst slurry was transferred to the reactor using slight nitrogen pressure and 0.03 moles of hydrogen were added by measuring through a calibrated Hoke 
 bomb. The stirring rate was adjusted to 1000 rpm and the temperature control unit set to 80° C. Ethylene pressure 
 was introduced when the autoclave reached 40 C., and the total reactor pressure was adjusted to 115 psi. Polymerizations were continued for 25-35 minutes in order to produce 130-150 grams of polymer. About 400 ppm of Irganox 1076 was added to the polymer/hexane slurry and the hexane was allowed to evaporate under a hood. The products were placed into a vacuum oven overnight at approximately 60' C. to 
 remove residual hexane and monomer. FIG. 2 shows the change in the copolymerization properties of the catalysts of Examples 2-4, as well as comparative A, as measured by resin density at the 1-3 4,481,301 21 I2 melt index level over a range of magnesium loadings into Davison 952 silica dried at 200 C. 
 If silica dried at 800 C, is used in place of silica dried at 200 C., the copolymerization properties of the cata lysts may vary. It is noted that silica dried at 200 C. contains about 6 SiOH groups/100 Angstrom? while silica dried at 800° C. contains only about 1 SiOH group/100 Angstrom. Ethylene/1-butene copolymers were prepared under similar conditions with both comparative A catalyst and the Example 2 catalyst. Table II summarizes the poly merization conditions and product properties of C2/C4 copolymers prepared with A and Example 2 catalysts. 
 Examination of the data in Table II indicates that under similar polymerization conditions the Example 2 cata lyst produced a lower density product than the A cata lyst.

 Examination of FIG. 4 clearly shows that the copoly merization properties of these three catalysts are Exam ple 3 > Example 2 > A. At a 1-hexene to ethylene ratio of about 1.3, the Example 2, Example 3 and A catalysts produced resins with densities of about 0.918 gm/cc, 0.927 gms/cc and 0.935 gms/cc, respectively. The Example 3. catalyst requires about 50 percent 
 (-10 percent) less 1-hexene in the reactor than A cata lyst to produce a LLDPE material with a density of about 0.920 gm/cc. Catalysts were utilized in a two gallon slurry labora tory reactor so that sufficient quantities of polymer 
 (500-800 gms) could be prepared for evaluation. Table IV and FIG. 5 summarize the polymerization condi tions and product properties of ethylene/1-hexene co polymers prepared with catalysts of Examples 3, 5, 6, 7 
 and A. Examination of FIG. 5 suggests that the relative copolymerization properties of these catalysts are (Ex ample 3, Example 5)&Example 6) Example 7d A.

 SO 
 However, at higher hydrogen levels, the Example 2 catalyst products produces a much higher melt index product than A (compare experiments 4 and 3 in Table 
 II). FIG. 3 illustrates the copolymerization differences between the A and Example 2 catalysts. FIG. 3 shows the density versus the butene/ethylene ratio for each of these catalysts. 
 Examination of FIG. 3 suggests that a 0.918 gm/cc LLDPE product requires a C4/C2 ratio of about 2.7 for A catalyst while the Example 2 catalyst requires only a ratio of 1.7. This corresponds to 35 percent less butene in the reactor for the Example 2 catalyst. Table III and FIG. 4 summarize the polymerization conditions and product properties of the ethylene/1- hexene copolymers prepared with A, Example 2 and 3 catalysts in a 1.6 liter slurry reactor. The Example 3 catalyst contains less magnesium and exhibits better 55 
 65 However, the differences between Example 3, Example 5 and Example 6 are relatively small (+10 percent) and may not be statistically significant.

This extra heat could result in se vere temperature gradients within certain fluid bed reactors and poor operability and/or bulk density. Therefore, even in gas phase, fluidized bed arrange ments which cannot optimally accommodate relatively high heat generating catalysts, such as the Example 2 catalyst, such fluidizing bed arrangements may readily accommodate relatively low heat generating catalysts, such as the Example 6 catalyst, without encountering problems of severe temperature gradients, poor opera 
 bility and/or poor bulk density.

 The performance of scaled up version of the catalyst of Example 6 (essentially the same as the aforemen tioned version except that the Mg loading in step A is 0.53 mmoles of mg instead of 0.38 mmoles/gl and A catalysts were compared under nearly identical operat 
 ing conditions in a fluidized-bed, pilot reactor. This comparison was accomplished keeping two important operating variables constant, namely temperature, and the molar ratio of hexene to ethylene in the gas phase, and then observing the phYsical properties of the resin product under these comparable conditions. The experiments were done in a pilot-scale fluidized bed reactor which is 18 inches in diameter and capable of producing up to 50 lb/hr of resin. The catalysts used for the comparison were A and the catalyst of Example 6 which was prepared at a pilot plant. The only differ ence between the pilot plant preparation of the catalyst of Example 6 and the laboratory procedure (described 
 earlier) was that a solvent decantation followed by several solvent washes was substituted for the filtration in Step B. Details of the comparison are found in Table VI, and support the slurry reactor findings that the catalyst of Example 6 has significantly improved copo lymerization properties compared to A when run under 
 similar reactor conditions.

 The hexene copolymer samples were extruded into 
 film at standard conditions on a Brabender blown film line. The system comprises a inch extruder feeding a one inch diameter blown film die. The die gap was 0.39 inches. Extrusion rate for all samples was 2.4 lb/hr, at a melt temperature of 185 to 195 C. The film was ex truded at a thickness of 1.5 mils, with a 2:1 blowup ratio and a 2: inch frost line height. All resin samples were stabilized with the same formulation; 700 ppm Kema mine AS 990 to neutralize catalyst residues, 200 ppm Irganox 1010 hindered phenolic antioxidant, and 200 ppm Weston 399 phosphite type peroxide decomposer. Physical properties were then run on the film in the product development laboratory. The values obtained in the laboratory are not in strict accordance with ASTM testing procedures, since the laboratory temper 
 ature and relative humidity are not controlled. The values reported are of merit in an approximate relative sense. Table VII lists the film properties measured on the A and Example 6 catalyzed samples prepared in the fluid bed pilot plant. MD tear strength is a measure of the resistance of the film to the propagation of a tear 
 initiated in the machine direction of the film. TD tear 
 measures the resistance of the film to the propagation of a tear initiated in the transverse direction of the film. Impact strength measures the amount of energy ab sorbed during a high speed puncture of the film. These tests are felt to be of significant value in the ranking of relative toughness.

 The improvement in properties of the Example 6 catalyzed hexene copolymers is due essentially to the improved comonomer incorporation, which results in a significantly lower density at the same reactor condi 
 tions. It can easily be seen from the data in Table VII that the Example 6 catalyzed samples (produced at reactor 
 conditions which bracket those of the A catalyzed sam plesl are much tougher in these tests than the A cata lyzed samples. Impact strength of the Example 6 cata lyzed samples is nearly double that of the A catalyzed samples. TD tear strength is more than 2.5 times that of the A samples, and MD tear strength averages more 
 than 3 times that of the A samples. The melt indices of these samples were all similar, between 1.3 and 1.7. Head pressure readings indicate that the processability of the A and Example 6 resins are essentially the same. 4,481,301 25 
 COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE B 
 The catalyst of this Comparative Example was pre pared in accordance with Example 7 of the Yamaguchi 
 et al U.S. Pat. No. 3,989,881. One will readily note the similarities between this comparative Example B cata lyst composition and the catalytically active precursor composition described in the Karol et al U.S. Pat. No. 4,302,566, e.g., exemplified in the passage extending 
 from line 65 of column 14 to line 26 of column 15. The particular procedure used to prepare the catalyst of comparative Example B is as follows. 15 g (158 mmol) of anhydrous magnesium chloride, MgCl2, was slurried in 530 ml dry tetrahydrofuran 
 (THF) in a one liter 3-necked round-bottomed flask fitted with a magnetic stirrer. 10 g (52.7 mmol) of TiCl4 were added dropwise while heating. The mixture was refluxed for approximately 
 one hour, by which time all solids had dissolved. After cooling, 275 ml hexane were added dropwise at 5 ml/minute to precipitate the solids. The mother-liquors 
 were decanted and the solid washed with two 200 ml 
 portions of hexane by decantation, and dried. The yel low solid contained 3.08 mmol Mg and 0.95 mmol Ti/g catalyst.

 dried at approximately 80 C. under a nitrogen purge. 
 15g of this product was slurried in 45.5 mmols of TiCl4 dissolved in 200 ml n-heptane, and the slurry refluxed for 45 minutes, using the same apparatus as described 
 above. The mixture was allowed to cool to room tem 
 perature, transferred to a filter flask under N2 and fil 
 tered. The solids were washed with three to four 
 100-150 ml portions of hexane and dried under a nitro gen purge. A free flowing yellow powder was obtained. Analyses for Ti and Mg are given in Table VIII. 
 COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE C 
 A catalyst was prepared in substantially the same 
 manner as described for Examples 8 and 9 except that the silica support was omitted. Further details are given 
 in Table VIII. It is noted that the formation of a small 
 amount of precipitate as evidenced by cloudiness was noticed as Grignard was added to hexane. This observa tion would have been masked if silica were present as a hexane slurry. 
 EXAMPLES 10-11 
 Catalysts prepared in the pilot plant were scaled up directly from laboratory preparations, except that de 
 cantation had to be used to wash the final catalyst rather than filtration, as described above Further preparation details are given in Table VIII.

 All procedures were carried out in glass or quartz equipment under purified nitrogen using predried nitro

 tomed flask fitted with a stirrer, thermometer, addition funnel, dry nitrogen line and a distillation head to re move solvent. The flask was placed in an oil bath main tained at a controlled temperature. 250 ml hexane was added to the silica while stirring under a slow nitrogen purge. The silica/hexane slurry was brought to reflux temperature and a 2.0 M solution of ethylmagnesium chloride in THF added dropwise 
 over 5-15 minutes. The reflux was continued for an 
 additional 30-40 minutes. After a total of 45 minutes the

The catalyst was activated in a catalyst addition flask by adding an amount of 25 weight percent triethylaluminum in hex ane to a given weight of catalyst suspended in 50 ml of dry hexane. Amounts used are given in Tables IX and X. The mixture was pressured into the reactor using nitrogen and the total reactor pressure adjusted to 20 psig with hydrogen. The reactor was heated at 3 C./minute with a set-point at 80 C. Ethylene was intro duced at 60° C. so as to maintain total operating pres sure at 120 psig, Polymerizations were carried out for approximately one hour, giving 450-950 g of polymer.

 ZEGLER-NATTA CATALYST AND METHOD FOR 
 MAKING AND USING SAME 
 FIELD OF THE INVENTION 
 0001. The present invention relates to catalysts, and par ticularly to Ziegler-Natta catalysts and to a method for making and using catalysts in polymerization reactions. 
 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 
 0002 Ziegler-Natta catalysts are advantageously used in 
 olefin polymerization reactions to produce Stereoregulated 
 linear polymers. It is known that Ziegler-Natta catalysts may 
 be formed by coating a Silica Support material with a magnesium-halide compound, a transition metal compound, electron donor compound(s) and an organo-aluminum 
 cocatalyst. The transition metal is an active catalytic ingre dient and the magnesium-halide compound may also be 
 thought of as being active to the extent that it acts as a Synergist to increase the overall catalytic productivity of the 
 transition metal. The electron donor compounds and organo 
 aluminum cocatalyst are important because they enable the Ziegler-Natta catalyst to catalyze polymerization of isotactic 
 polymers. The Silica material is inactive and does not increase polymerization reaction rates. 
 0003. It is known that silica-based Ziegler-Natta catalysts may be produced from high-porosity Silica particles in the 
 diameter range of about 10-100 microns, which may be coated with 1 or more relatively thin layers of a magnesium halide compound to form a catalyst Support, which may be 
 treated with a transition metal to form a catalyst. However, this type of catalyst generally comprises a high ratio of 
 inactive Silica relative to the active ingredients. Further, the catalyst Supports may need to be mechanically treated to produce generally Spherical, or spheroidal, catalyst Supports 
 of the appropriate diameter and particle diameter distribu tion, which will form catalyst particles of the appropriate 
 diameter and particle diameter distribution and, thus, will facilitate efficient polymerization reactions. 
 0004 U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,293,673 and 4,376,062, both to Hamer et al., disclose methods for forming Silica based catalysts with very Small Silica particles, no larger than about 
 0.05 micron, which are mixed in a slurry to form solid agglomerations comprising a number of Silica particles 
 mixed with active ingredients. While Hamer utilizes silica particles which are very Small, the resulting catalysts Still 
 comprise at least 10 wt % inert silica material. This is 
 undesirable because the higher the relative amount of inert Silica material the lower the Overall activity of the catalyst, and the higher the amount of catalyst residues in a polymer 
 formed therewith. Thus, the production costs of the polymer, per weight unit of catalyst, is higher for catalysts containing 
 relatively large amounts of inert material. Further, higher amounts of catalyst residues may detrimentally affect poly mer processing and/or the physical properties of products 
 made with the polymer. 
 0005 Thus, there is a need for an efficient and reliable method for producing catalyst Support materials, and ulti mately catalysts, which comprise a relatively Small percent 
 age of inactive materials, and which have a relatively Smooth spherical or spheroidal shape and Suitable average

 DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED 
 EMBODIMENTS 
 0011. The present invention generally concerns Ziegler Natta catalysts and processes for making and using Same, 
 which may include coating a Silica Support material, acting as a Seeding agent, with a magnesium compound to form a 
 Solid catalyst Support. The catalyst Support may be reacted 
 with a transition metal, an internal electron donor, an organo-aluminum co-catalyst and an external electron donor 
 to form a catalyst Suitable for, for example, various poly 
 merization reactions. 
 0012. In a preferred process, a Silica Seeding agent is 
 dispersed in a non-polar, non-ionic oil, for example, mineral 
 oil, paraffin oil or Silicone oil, in a mixing apparatus Such as a simple paddle Stirrer operating at a few hundred rpms or 
 a Ultra-Turrax(RT 50 Homogenizer with stirring speeds up to 10,000 rpms. Preferably, the ratio of silica seeding agent 
 to oil is in the range of about 0.25 grams per liter to about 25.0 grams per liter, more preferably about 1.0 gram per liter 
 to about 10.0 grams per liter. The Silica Seeding agent is 
 described in more detail below. 
 0013 Anhydrous magnesium halide compound can be 
 added to the dispersion of silica in oil, followed by addition 
 of an alkanol Solvent Such as anhydrous ethanol, methanol, or 2-ethyl-1-hexanol. Alternatively, anhydrous ethanol, 
 methanol or 2-ethyl-1-hexanol can be added to an anhydrous 
 (i.e., less than about 0.5 wt % HO) magnesium-halide compound to form a Soluble complex, as described below. 
 About 0.01 wt % to about 10.0 wt %, more preferably from 
 about 0.1 wt % to about 5.0 wt %, and still more preferably US 2006/0046928A1 
 from about 0.5 wt % to about 3.0 wt % of the silica seeding agent is used relative to the magnesium-halide compound. 
 Generally, a higher ratio of magnesium-halide to Silica 
 Seeding agent in the mixture results in a higher ratio of magnesium-halide to Silica in the catalyst Support formed and, consequently, a larger catalyst Support is expected to 
 form because more magnesium-halide crystalizes onto the Silica Seeding agent. 
 0.014. The solvent is added in amounts from about 2 to 20 times, preferably about 6 times, the molar ratio of the magnesium-halide compound to facilitate the liquefying of 
 the magnesium-halide compound at a lower temperature. 
 U.S. Pat. No. 4,421,674 to Invernizzi et al. teaches, for 
 example, that when the mole ratio of ethanol (“EtOH') to MgCl, is 102, the complex liquefies at 60° C.; at a mole ratio of EtOH to MgCl2 of 7.75 the complex liquefies at 80° C.; 
 at a mole ratio of EtOH to MgCl, of 6.51 the complex liquefies at 90° C.; and at a mole ratio of EtOH to MgCl, of 5.43 the complex liquefies at 100° C. The mixture is initially translucent due to the Suspension of the magnesium-halide 
 compound and the Silica Seeding agent. The mixture is 
 heated to about 60° C. to about 140°C., preferably about 80° 
 C. to about 120° C., until the solvent begins to reflux and the magnesium-halide compound goes into Solution, whereupon 
 the mixture becomes transparent, and the temperature is 
 maintained at the reflux temperature for about 0.25 hours to about 3.0 hours, preferably about 1.0 hour to about 2.0 hours, preferably with continuous stirring. It is possible to 
 form the mixture without either the oil or the Solvent, or by mixing the ingredients in a different order, but the above 
 described mixing operation has been shown to result in a well-dispersed mixture. 
 0015 The clear mixture, which includes a MgCl2.xEtOH complex (where X is an integer from 1-20), is rapidly transferred to a Second mixing apparatus containing a pre 
 chilled hydrocarbon Solvent, Such as heptane, hexane, cyclo hexane, or other aliphatic or cycloaliphatic hydrocarbon 
 which is miscible in the oil and which will not freeze at the 
 temperatures necessary for the Solidification of the MgCl2.xEtOH complex. The hydrocarbon solvent is pre 
 chilled, for example, to between ice (0° C.) and dry ice/ isopropanol temperatures (i.e., about -70° C. to -90° C.). The rapid temperature decrease causes almost all of the magnesium-halide compound to precipitate out of Solution 
 and crystallize onto the Silica Seeding agent, thus coating the Silica Seeding agent to form a catalyst Support. The catalyst 
 Support particles preferably include less than 10 wt % Silica, 
 preferably no more than 5 wt % silica, and more preferably 
 no more than 3 wt % Silica. 
 0016. After about 0.5 to 2 hours, preferably about 1 hour, 
 the mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature and it is filtered. Approximately Spherical and/or Spheroidal Solid 
 catalyst Support particles, each comprising at least one Silica Seeding agent with magnesium-halide crystals attached 
 thereto, are collected and washed Several times with more hydrocarbon Solvent, until the hydrocarbon Solvent appears 
 to be colorless, and are dried (e.g., vacuum dried) in a rotary evaporator at about 40 C. to 80 C., preferably at about 60 
 C., for 1 to 3 hours, preferably for about 2 hours. The term “approximately Spherical' or “approximately Spheroidal' 
 means that all points on the Surface of the particle are within 
 the range of radius r to 2r wherein r is the minimum radial 
 distance between the center of the particle and the closest Mar. 2, 2006 
 point thereto on the Surface of the particle. The magnesium halide compound may alternately be crystallized onto the 
 Silica Seeding agent with known Spray drying techniqueS or 
 by gradually evaporating the Solvent in which it was origi 
 nally dissolved. 
 0017 Next, the catalyst support is slowly added to about 
 10 to 50 moles of a transition metal compound for each mole of magnesium in the magnesium-halide compound at about 
 -30 to 50 C., and the temperature of this mixture is raised 
 to about 20 to 80°C., preferably about 30-60° C. An internal electron donor is added and the temperature is raised, generally with stirring, to about 80 to 130 C., preferably 
 100-110° C., and is kept at that level for about 1 to 3 hours, preferably about 2 hours. 
 0018. The internal electron donor compound, in general, 
 is used in an amount from about 0.05 to about 2.0 moles, 
 preferably about 0.1 to about 0.5 mole, for each mole of magnesium in the magnesium-halide compound. 
 0019. The result is a mixture comprising solid catalyst 
 particles and unreacted transition metal compound and inter 
 nal electron donor compound. 
 0020. The solid catalyst particles are filtered out and, 
 preferably, extracted for about 1 to 3 hours, preferably about 
 2 hours, at about 110 to 140 C., more preferably about 125 C. with a mixture of transition metal compound (about 5 to 30 wt %, preferably about 10 wt %), and an inert solvent, Such as a C-C alkylbenzene, preferably ethylbenzene 
 (about 70 to 85 wt %, preferably about 90 wt %) in a known “Soxhlet” extraction type arrangement. This extraction treat ment enhances catalyst activity and Stereospecificity. Alter 
 natively, the Solid catalyst may receive any number of other 
 known extraction treatments, which may, but need not, include a transition metal treatment. Alternatively, the cata lyst could simply be boiled in a Solution comprising a 
 transition metal compound with or without an inert Solvent, 
 i.e., a Solvent which will not react with the transition metal 
 compound. U.S. Pat. No. 4,745,164 to Schweier et al. and 
 U.S. Pat. No. 6,034,023 to Kersting et al., which are incor porated by reference herein, teach examples of extraction 
 methods which may be utilized in the present invention. 
 0021. The Solid catalyst may be recovered by filtration, 
 washed with an inert Solvent, Such as heptane, hexane, cyclohexane or other aliphatic or cycloaliphatic hydrocar 
 bon, dried by draining off transition metal compound and 
 Solvent, washed a Second time with the inert Solvent, and 
 dried. 
 0022. The solid catalyst Support particles and/or catalyst 
 particles preferably comprise about 0.01 wt % to about 10 wt 
 % silica, more preferably about 0.1 wt % to about 5 wt % 
 Silica. 
 0023 The solid catalyst Support particles and/or catalyst particles preferably have a weight percent ratio of Silica to 
 magnesium-halide compound in the range of about 1:20 to 
 1:3, preferably from about 1:10 to 1:4. 
 0024. The catalyst may preferably be treated with an organo-aluminum co-catalyst and an external electron donor or other Stereoregulating agent to form a Ziegler-Natta 
 catalyst, which may be used, for example, in polymerization 
 reactions. Examples of external electron donor compounds 
 which may be used in the catalytic System of the invention US 2006/0046928A1 
 include mono- and polyfunctional carboxylic acids, car boxylic anhydrides and carboxylic esters, and ketones, 
 ethers, alcohols, lactones as well as organic phosphorus and 
 Silicon compounds. Also, a mixture of two or more external 
 electron donor compounds can be used. The external elec 
 tron donor compound and the internal electron donor com pound used in the preparation of the Solid catalyst compo 
 nent may be the same or different. Preferred external electron donor compounds are disclosed below. 
 0.025 In such cases the organo-aluminum co-catalyst and 
 the external electron donor may be contacted with the Solid catalyst Separately, in any order, or together, preferably at a 
 temperature from about 0 to 200 C., more preferably from 
 about 20 to 90° C., and preferably at a pressure of about 1 
 to 100 bar, more preferably from about 1 to 40 bar. 
 0.026 Preferably, the organo-aluminum co-catalyst is 
 added in Such an amount that the molar ratio of the alumi 
 num co-catalyst to the transition metal in the Solid catalyst 
 is from about 10:1 to about 800:1, more preferably from 
 about 20:1 to about 200:1. 
 0027. The external electron donor is used with the cata lyst in amounts ranging from about 1 to 100 moles, prefer 
 ably 10 to 30 moles, for each mole of transition metal in the catalyst. Generally, it is highly preferred that an external 
 electron donor, with or without the organo-aluminum co 
 catalyst, be used in order to maintain a high level of Stereospecificity in polymers produced with the catalysts of 
 the invention. 
 0028. A preferred silica seeding agent is a microspheroi 
 dal silica (SiO2), for example, a fumed Silica Such as CAB-O-SIL(R-5 (Cabot Corporation; Midland, Mich.). Other Silica Seeding agents may include, for example, Aero 
 sile) fumed silica, available from USA Midwest Degussa Corporation, 3500 Embassy Parkway Ste. 100, Akron Ohio 
 4.4333. 
 0029. The silica seeding agent is characterized by its relatively Small average particle diameter, i.e., preferably 
 about 0.005-10 microns, more preferably about 0.001-5.0 microns, most preferably from about 0.01 microns to about 1.0 micron. The Silica Seeding agent has low porosity 
 because of its lack of, or Small quantity of, pores. That is, it 
 has a porosity of less than about 0.5 cc/gram as measured by nitrogen adsorption, which indicates that the Silica particles 
 have relatively Smooth Surfaces. The Silica Seeding agent particles have relatively uniform spherical or spheroidal shape, i.e., approximately Spherical shape, and preferably 
 having a radius which does not vary by more than about 20% from the center to any point on the Surface of the particle. The particles of the Silica Seeding agent have a relatively 
 small particle diameter distribution, such that 50% of the Silica particles have particle diameters ranging from about 
 0.05 microns to about 0.5 microns. 
 0030 The small particle diameter of the silica seeding agent is significant because the resulting catalyst will ulti mately comprise a relatively Small percentage, i.e., less than 
 10 wt %, of inert silica material as compared to the total weight of the catalyst Support. Thus, the catalyst will operate 
 more efficiently because a relatively larger portion of the 
 Solid catalyst will comprise active catalytic material, i.e., the transition metal and the magnesium-halide Synergist. In preferred catalyst Supports the Silica component will be leSS Mar. 2, 2006 
 than 10 wt % of the total catalyst Support weight, more 
 preferably about 0.1 wt % to about 5 wt %, and yet more 
 preferably about 0.5 wt % to about 3.0 wt % of the catalyst Support formed by the above-described processes. Since the Silica Seeding agent provides a Surface upon which the magnesium-halide compound will crystallize, the Smooth 
 approximately spherical shape and Small particle diameter 
 distribution of the Silica Seeding agent will result in catalyst Support particles, and ultimately catalyst particles, with a 
 relatively Smooth approximately spherical shape and Small 
 particle diameter distribution. These qualities will contribute to an efficient polymerization process with a relatively Small 
 amount of fines in polymers produced in reactions con 
 ducted with the catalysts of the invention. This is an advan tage over other catalysts which, for example, may need to undergo various complex and expensive processes in order to acquire an approximately Spherical shape and/or accept 
 able particle diameter and particle diameter distribution. 
 0031. The diameters of the catalyst support particles will 
 range from about 5-150 microns, more preferably from 
 about 20-60 microns, most preferably from about 20-40 microns. The particle size distribution of the catalyst Support particles is Such that 50% of the catalyst Support particles 
 have particle diameters ranging from about 20 microns to 
 about 60 microns. 
 0032. The catalyst particles will have diameters which are about 20%-50% smaller. For example, a support particle 
 with a 70 micron diameter may result in a catalyst particle 
 with a 50-60 micron diameter. The reason for this reduction 
 in Size is as follows. It is generally known that ethanol dissolves the MgCl2 by first Swelling the structure of the solid MgCl. (MgCl2 has a layered structure. Ethanol occu pies the interstitial spaces between the MgCl2 layers.) AS 
 more alcohol is added and/or the material is heated, this Structure continues to Swell or expand until the MgCl, layers Segregate and the MgCloEtOH complex becomes a liquid. 
 When this complex is reacted with TiCl, the removal of 
 ethanol causes the Structure and thus the particle to Shrink or diminish in size. Thus, the catalyst Supports and catalysts of 
 the invention are notable for having relatively thick layers of active ingredients, referring to both the Synergistic magne 
 sium-halide layer and active transition metal layer, on rela tively Small Silica particles. Again, this results in the overall percentage of inactive Silica delivered to a polymerization 
 reactor to be lower than in other known processes. Conse quently, overall efficiency in the polymerization reactor will be higher. 
 0033 Preferably, catalyst Support particles and catalyst 
 particles of the invention will each include one Silica Seed particle, or a Small group of Silica Seed particles comprising 
 less than 10% of the total catalyst Support weight. In contrast 
 to the present invention, other known catalysts typically comprise relatively large Silica particles or agglomerations 
 of a number of very Small Silica particles within each catalyst Support particle Such that there is a relatively larger 
 amount (e.g., up to 50 wt %) of inert Silica in the catalyst particle. 
 0034. The magnesium compound is an inorganic solid 
 magnesium-halide compound containing at least one halo 
 gen atom, Such as magnesium chloride, magnesium bromide 
 and magnesium iodide, as well as mixed halogen oxides or hydroxides like chloromagnesium hydroxide, bromomagne US 2006/0046928A1 
 sium hydroxide and iodomagnesium hydroxide. Among 
 these compounds the magnesium dihalides corresponding to 
 the formula MgX are preferred wherein X is a halogen. Especially preferred is magnesium chloride (MgCl). Pref 
 erably, the inorganic Solid magnesium-halide compound is 
 in a Substantially anhydrous condition. 
 0.035 Transition metal compounds for treating the cata 
 lyst Support are preferably titanium or Vanadium com 
 pounds. Titanium compounds useful in preparing the Solid 
 catalyst component include the halogenides of tri- or tet 
 ravalent titanium. Titanium alkoxy halogenide compounds 
 and mixtures of two or more titanium compounds are also contemplated. Examples of Suitable titanium compounds 
 include TiBr, TiBri, TiCl, TiCl, Ti(OCH)Cl. Ti(OCH3)Cls, Ti(O-iso-CH2)C1, Ti(O-n-CHg)Cls, 
 Ti(OCH)Br, Ti(O-n-CH-)Br, Ti(OCH) Cl, 
 Ti(OCH3)Cl., Ti(O-n-CH3)2Cl2, Ti(OCH3)Br, 
 Ti(OCH) Cl, Ti(OCH) Cl, Ti(O-n-CHo). Cl, Ti(OCH), Br, Ti(OCH), Ti(OCH), or Ti(O-n-CHo). 
 Preferred titanium compounds include those wherein the 
 halogen is chlorine. Also preferred are those titanium halo 
 genides that in addition to the titanium contain only halogen, 
 and of these the titanium chlorides, and in particular titanium 
 tetrachloride, are preferred. 
 0.036 Vanadium compounds useful in the preparation of 
 the Solid catalytic component of the catalytic System 
 described herein include the Vanadium halogenides, the 
 Vanadium oxyhalogenides, the Vanadium alkoxides and 
 Vanadium acetylacetonate. Preferred Vanadium compounds 
 are those having oxidation Stages 3 to 5. 
 0037. The function of the internal and external electron 
 donors, e.g., Lewis bases, is two-fold. One function is to block “coordinately unsaturated' Sites on the magnesium 
 compound So that the active site, the transition metal com 
 pound, will not attach to those Sites. The other function is to 
 reduce the “coordinately unsaturated” environment around 
 the bound active site in order to improve its Stereospecificity. 
 Both results are the Same, i.e. the electron donors improve the isotacticity or Stereoregularity of polymers produced 
 with the catalyst. The reason for this is that a “coordinately 
 unsaturated' Site has a lower energy barrier for binding 
 propylene in various configurations, i.e., it can bond to 
 propylene in multiple ways, leading to a reduction in poly 
 mer isotacticity and Subsequently lower polymer crystallin 
 ity. Lower polymer crystallinity results in lower polymer melting points and increased hydrocarbon (e.g., xylene, 
 decalin, or heptane) Solubles. A “coordinatively Saturated” Site will predominately bond to the active site in only one way. As a result, a coordinatively Saturated Site produces 
 uniform or isotactic polypropylene. 
 0.038 Internal electron donor compounds which may be used in the preparation of the Solid catalytic component 
 include, at least, mono or polyfunctional carboxylic acids, carboxylic anhydrides, or carboxylic esters, and also 
 ketones, ethers, alcohols, lactones or organophosphorous or organosilicon compounds. 
 0.039 Preferred internal electron donor compounds included carboxylic acid derivatives and, in particular, phthalic acid derivatives having the general formula (I): Mar. 2, 2006 
 (I) 
 wherein X and Y each represent a chlorine or bromine atom or a C-Co alkoxy group, or X and Y taken together represent an oxygen atom forming an anhydride function. 
 Particularly preferred internal electron donor compounds are 
 phthalic esters of formula (I) wherein X and Y each are a C-Cs alkoxy group, such as a methoxy, ethoxy, n-propyloxy, isopropyloxy, n-butyloxy, Sec-butyloxy, or tert-butyloxy 
 group. Examples of preferred phthalic esters include diethyl phthalate, di-n-butyl phthalate, di-isobutyl phthalate, di-n- pentyl phthalate, di-n-hexyl phthalate, di-n-heptyl phthalate, 
 di-n-octyl phthalate or di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate. 
 0040. Further examples of preferred internal electron 
 donor compounds include diesters of 3- or 4-membered, optionally Substituted cycloalkane 1,2-dicarboxylic acids, as 
 well as monoesters of Substituted benzophenone 2-carboxy 
 lic acids or Substituted benzophenone 3-carboxylic acids. AS hydroxy compounds in the esterfication reaction for synthe 
 sis of these esters, alkanols Such as C-C or Cs-C7 cycloal kanols (optionally Substituted with one or more C-C alkyl groups), as well as C-Co phenols, can be used. A particu larly preferred internal electron donor is di-alkyl carboxylic 
 acid ester. 
 0041. A further group of suitable internal electron donor compounds are the non-Substituted and Substituted (C-Co alkyl)-1,3-propane diethers and derivatives of the group of 
 Succinates. 
 0042. Also, mixtures of two or more internal electron donor compounds may be used in the preparation of the Solid catalytic component of the invention. 
 0043. Examples of external electron donor compounds 
 which may be used in the catalytic System of the invention include mono- and polyfunctional carboxylic acids, car 
 boxylic anhydrides and carboxylic esters, and ketones, 
 ethers, alcohols, lactones as well as organic phosphorus and 
 Silicon compounds. Also, a mixture of two or more external electron donor compounds can be used. The external elec 
 tron donor compound and the internal electron donor com pound used in the preparation of the Solid catalyst compo 
 nent may be the same or different. However, it is generally 
 preferred that the internal and external electron donors be 
 different because the desired internal electron donor is one 
 which will block sites that lead to “coordinative unsatura 
 tion” or that transform “coordinatively unsaturated” sites 
 into “coordinatively Saturated' Sites. And yet these internal 
 electron donors do not react with TiCl. In the case of 
 external electron donors, the desired molecule is one that 
 will have the same affect on “coordinative Saturation', but will not react with the aluminum alkyl cocatalyst. A mol 
 ecule that yields “coordinative unsaturation” yet does not 
 react with either TiCl, and AlR would be ideal. However, US 2006/0046928A1 
 due to the difficulty in finding Such a Single Substance, most polypropylene catalysts employ two separate Substances for 
 their internal and external electron donors. 
 0044 Preferred external electron donor compounds include the organosilicon compounds of the general formula 
 (II): 
 R""Si(OR), (II) 
 0045 wherein each R' may be the same or different and represents a C-Coalkyl group, a 5- to 7-membered cyclic 
 alkyl group optionally Substituted with C-C alkyl, a C-C1s aryl group or a Co-C1s aryl-C-Cio alkyl group; and each R may be the same or different and represents a C-Coalkyl group; and n is an integer equal to 1, 2 or 3. 
 0046 Preferred compounds of formula (II) are diisopro pyldimethoxysilane, isobutylisopropyl-dimethoxysilane, 
 disobutyldimethoxysilane, dicyclopentyl-dimethoxysilane, cyclohexylmethyldimethoxysilane, dicyclohexyldimethoX 
 ySilane, isopropyl-tert-butyldimethoxysilane, isopropyl-Sec 
 butyldimethoxysilane, and isobutyl-Sec-butyldimethoxysi 
 lane. 
 0047. Other stereoregulating agents which may be sub 
 Stituted for the external electron donor include alcohols, phenols, ketones, aldehydes, carboxylic acids, organic or 
 inorganic acid esters, ethers, acid amides and acid anhy 
 drides, and nitrogen-containing electron donors Such as 
 ammonia, amines, 
 0.048 nitriles and isocyanates. Specific examples include 
 alcohols having 1 to 18 carbon atoms which may have an alkyl group Such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, pentanol, 
 hexanol, octanol, 2-ethylhexanol, dodecanol, octadecyl 
 alcohol, benzyl alcohol, phenylethyl alcohol, cumyl alcohol and isopropylbenzyl alcohol; phenols having 6 to 25 carbon 
 atoms Such as phenol, creSol, Xylenol, ethylphenol, propy lphenol, cumylphenol, nonylphenol and naphthol, ketones 
 having 3 to 15 carbon atoms Such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, acetophenone and ben 
 Zophenone; aldehydes having 2 to 15 carbon atoms Such as acetaldehyde, propionaldehyde, octylaldehyde, benzalde 
 hyde, tolualdehyde and naphthaldehyde; organic acid esters 
 having 2 to 30 carbon atoms Such as methyl formate, ethyl acetate, Vinyl acetate, propyl acetate, octyl acetate, cyclo hexyl acetate, ethyl propionate, methylbutyrate, ethyl Val 
 erate, ethyl Stearate, methyl chloroacetate, ethyl dichloroac etate, methyl methacrylate, ethylcrotonate, dibutyl maleate, diethylbutylmalonate, diethyl dibutylmalonate, ethyl cyclo hexanecarboxylate, diethyl 12-cyclohexane-dicarboxylate, 
 di-2-ethylhexyl 12-cyclohexanedicarboxylate, methylben 
 Zoate, ethylbenzoate, propylbenzoate, butylbenzoate, octyl 
 benzoate, cyclohexyl benzoate, phenyl benzoate, benzyl 
 benzoate, methyl toluate, ethyl toluate, amyl toluate, ethyl ethylbenzoate, methyl anisate, ethyl anisate, ethyl ethoxy 
 benzoate, dimethyl phthalate, diethyl phthalate, dibutyl phthalate, dioctyl phthalate, gamma-butyrolactone, delta 
 Valerolactone, coumarin, phthalide and ethylene carbonate; inorganic acid esterS Such as ethyl Silicate, butyl Silicate, Vinyltriethoxysilane, phenyltriethoxysilane and diphenyldi 
 ethoxysilane; acid halides having 2 to 15 carbon atoms Such 
 as acetyl chloride, benzoyl chloride, tolyl chloride, anisoyl 
 chloride and phthaloyl dichloride; ethers having 2 to 20 carbon atoms Such as methyl ether, ethyl ether, isopropyl 
 ether, butyl ether, amyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, anisole and Mar. 2, 2006 
 diphenyl ether; acid amides Such as acetamide, benzamide and toluamide; acid anhydrides Such as benzoic anhydride and phthalic anhydride, amines Such as methylamine, ethy lamine, diethylamine, tributylamine, piperidine, tribenzy 
 lamine, aniline, pyridine, picoline and tetramethylethylene 
 diamine; and nitriles Such as acetonitrile, benzonitrile and 
 tolunitrile. 
 0049 Polymerization is initiated by formation of a metal 
 carbon bond (Ti-C). The function of the aluminum alkyl is to alkylate the TiCl. This can be accomplished in a variety 
 of ways: by addition of aluminum alkyl to the reactor Separate from the catalyst, by premixing the aluminum alkyl 
 with the catalyst prior to addition to the reactor, or by 
 premixing of the aluminum alkyl and external electron donor prior to mixing with the catalyst. 
 0050 Examples of Suitable organo-aluminum co-cata 
 lysts include aluminum trialkyls (AIR) and derivatives thereof wherein an alkyl group is Substituted by an alkoxy 
 group or a halogen atom, e.g. chlorine or bromine atom. The alkyl groups may be the same or different. The alkyl groups 
 may be linear or branched chain alkyl groups. Preferred trialkylaluminum compounds are those wherein the alkyl 
 groups each have 1 to 8 C-atoms, Such as trimethylalumi num, triethylaluminum, tri-isobutylaluminum, trioctylalu 
 minum or methyldiethyl aluminum. 
 0051. The equipment used in the processes of the inven 
 tion are well known in the art and, generally, may be 
 substituted for by those familiar with catalysts and their production. Reactor Systems can include high pressure, 
 Stainless Steel vessels, low preSSure, glass vessels, CSTR 
 vessels, loop reactors, Vertical Stirred-bed gas phase reac 
 tors, horizontal Stirred-bed gas phase reactors, Vertical, 
 fluid-bed gas phase reactors, and the like. 
 0052 The catalysts of the present invention were tested for polymerization performance using a 2-liter, jacketed, 
 stainless steel reactor available from Pressure Products 
 Industries, Inc., 900 Louis Drive, Warminster, Pa. 18974. Liquid propylene was metered in using a high preSSure Site-glass. Hydrogen was added by measuring the preSSure 
 differential across a 300 ml vessel. 
 0053 A test sample of a preferred catalyst of the inven 
 tion was prepared and tested as follows: 
 Catalyst Preparation Procedure 
 0054) 50 milligrams of CAB-O-SIL(R) was dispersed in 
 about 250 ml of mineral oil in a flask by stirring. Subse quently, 10 grams of anhydrous MgCl, followed by 6 equivalents of anhydrous ethanol (per equivalent of magne 
 sium) was added. The mixture was heated until the ethanol began to reflux. The mixture was maintained at this tem perature for about 1 hour with continuous Stirring. 
 0055. The contents of the flask were then rapidly trans ferred to a Second flask containing 1 liter of heptane pre chilled to dry icefisopropanol temperatures. After an hour 
 the temperature of the contents of the Second flask were 
 allowed to warm to room temperature and were then filtered. Approximately Spherical Solid catalyst Support particles 
 were collected and washed Several times with heptane, until the Washings appeared to be colorleSS, and then Vacuum dried in a rotary evaporator at 60° C. for about 2 hours. US 2006/0046928A1 
 0056 Next, the solid catalyst Support particles were 
 added slowly to a third flask containing 200 ml of neat TiCl, 
 which had been pre-cooled to about 0° C. After the tem perature was raised to about 50-60 C., 1.5 ml of di-n- butylphthalate, a di-alkylcarboxylic acid ester, as an internal 
 electron donor, was added. The contents of the third flask were heated to 100-110° C. and held at that temperature for 
 about 2 hours. 
 0057 The heat was removed, and solid catalyst particles 
 and liquid from the third flask were transferred to a Soxlet extractor. The liquid, which comprised unreacted TiCl, and 
 internal electron donor compound, was removed by filtering through a porous Sintered glass filter that is part of the 
 reaction vessel. The remaining Solid catalyst particles were 
 then extracted for about two hours at 125 C. with a mixture 
 of 90% ethylbenzene and 10% TiCl. This TiCl, treatment greatly enhances the performance of the catalyst. 
 0.058 At the conclusion of the extraction, the Solid cata lyst particles were dried by draining off residual TiCland ethylbenzene, Washing with heptane, and vacuum drying. 
 The polymerization productivity of the catalyst was then 
 tested using the general polymerization procedure described 
 below. 
 Polymerization Testing Procedure 
 0059) A quantity of 4 ml of 25 wt % triethylaluminum 
 (TEAl) was added to a leg of a two-leg stainless Steel injector, along with 2 ml of a 0.1 molar Solution of cyclo hexylmethyl dimethoxysilane, as an external electron donor. 
 The aluminum alkyl activates the catalyst by replacing one 
 of the chlorides on the titanium with an alkyl group. There after, alkylation can propagate continued insertion of pro pylene groups during a polymerization reaction. The exter 
 nal electron donor is important for controlling the nature of the propylene insertion, but it is not necessary for Starting or maintaining propylene insertion. 
 0060 20 Milligrams of a mixture containing 2 parts anhydrous MgCl2 and 1 part of the experimental catalyst 
 prepared above was added to another leg of the injector. The experimental catalyst was diluted in this manner to facilitate 
 more accurate measurement of Small quantities of catalyst 
 tested in this example. The injector was then attached to the 
 reactor So that the contents of the injector legs could be charged to the reactor under inert atmospheric conditions. 
 0061 A polymerization reaction vessel comprising a 2-li 
 ter, Stainless Steel, jacketed pressure vessel, was purged of 
 moisture and oxygen by heating to at least 100° C. while a 
 Slow bleed of dry nitrogen was maintained through the 
 vessel. The TEAl and external electron donor were added to 
 the reactor by flushing the appropriate injector leg with 
 600-800 ml of propylene. The catalyst was then added in a 
 similar fashion by flushing the other leg of the injector with 200-400 ml of liquid propylene. 100 delta-psig (as measured 
 across a 300 ml vessel) of hydrogen was added to the reactor. 
 The vessel was sealed and heated to about 70° C. Once the 
 temperature was at about 70° C., the polymerization reaction 
 was allowed to continue for one hour. The polymerization reaction was then Stopped by venting the residual propylene. 
 The polymerization reaction vessel was opened and polymer 
 was removed. 
 0.062 Catalyst productivity was measured by dividing the grams of polymer produced by the milligrams of active 
 catalyst initially charged to the reactor. Mar. 2, 2006 
 0063. The catalysts of the invention may be advanta geously used in the polymerization of alk-1-enes. Suitable 
 alk-1-enes include linear or branches C-Co alkenes, in particular linear C-C alk-1-enes Such as ethylene, propy 
 lene, but-1-ene, pent-1-ene, hex-1-ene, hept-1-ene, Oct-1- 
 ene non-1-ene, dec-1-ene or 4-methylpent-1-ene. Mixtures 
 of these alk-1-enes may be polymerized as well. 
 0064. The catalysts of the invention are, in particular, excellent catalytic Systems for use in the production of propylene polymers, both homopolymers of propylene as 
 well as copolymers of propylene and one or more further 
 alk-1-enes having up to 10 carbon atoms. 
 0065. The term copolymers as used herein also refers to copolymers wherein the further alk-1-ene having up to 10 carbon atoms is incorporated randomly. In these copolymers 
 the comonomer content is generally less than about 15% by weight. The copolymerS may also be in the form of So-called block or impact copolymers, which comprise at least a 
 matrix of a propylene homopolymer or propylene random 
 copolymer containing less than 15% by weight of a further 
 alk-1-ene having up to 10 carbon atoms and a Soft phase of a propylene copolymer containing about 15% to about 80% 
 by weight of further alk-1-enes having up to 10 C-atoms. 
 Also mixtures of comonomers are contemplated, resulting in, e.g., terpolymers of propylene. 
 0066. The production of the propylene polymers may be 
 carried out in any common reactor Suitable for the polymer 
 ization of alk-1-enes, either batchwise or, preferably, con tinuously, i.e., in Solution (bulk phase), as Suspension poly merization or as gas phase polymerization. Examples of 
 Suitable reactors include continuously operated Stirred reac 
 tors, loop reactors, fluid bed reactors, or horizontal or 
 vertical stirred powder bed reactors. It will be understood that the polymerization may be carried out in a Series of consecutively coupled reactors. The reaction time depends 
 on the chosen reaction conditions. In general the reaction time is from about 0.2 hours to about 10 hours, usually from 
 about 0.5 hours to 5.0 hours. 
 0067. In general the polymerization is carried out at a 
 temperature in the range of from about 20° C. to about 150 C., preferably from about 50° C. to about 120° C., and more preferably from about 60° C. to about 90° C., and a pressure 
 in the range of from about 1 bar to about 100 bar, preferably 
 from about 15 bar to about 40 bar, and more preferably from 
 about 20 bar to 35 bar. 
 0068 The molecular weight of the so produced polymers 
 may be controlled and adjusted over a wide range by adding 
 polymer chain transfer or termination inducing agents as commonly used in the art of polymerization, Such as hydro 
 gen. In addition an inert Solvent, Such as toluene or hexane, or an inert gas, Such as nitrogen or argon, and Smaller amounts of a powdered polymer, e.g., polypropylene pow 
 der, may be added. 
 0069. The weight, i.e., (average molecular weights) of the propylene polymers produced by using the catalytic System 
 of the invention, in general, are in the range of from about 10,000 g/mole to 1,000,000 g/mole and the melt flow rates 
 are in the range of from about 0.1 to about 100 g/10 min, 
 preferably from about 0.5 to about 50 g/10 min. The melt flow rate corresponds to the amount which is pressed within 
 10 minutes from a test instrument in accordance with ISO US 2006/0046928A1 
 1133 at a temperature of 230 C. and under a load of 2.06 kg. Certain applications might require different molecular 
 weights than those mentioned above and are contemplated to be included among the polymers which are produced with 
 the catalysts of the invention. 
 0070 The catalytic systems of the invention enable the polymerization of alk-1-enes to produce polymers having a good morphology and a high bulk density when compared 
 with the prior art catalytic Systems. In addition, the catalytic 
 Systems of the invention have an increased productivity. 
 0071. Due to their good mechanical properties the poly merS obtainable by using the Solid catalytic component of 
 the present invention, and in particular the propylene homopolymerS or the copolymers of propylene with one or 
 more further alk-1-enes having up to 10 carbon atoms, can be used advantageously for the production of fibers or moldings, and especially for the production of films. 
 0.072 Ziegler-Natta catalysts are the subject of continued improvements, because their properties Such as activity/ productivity, morphology, and Stereospecificity Strongly 
 effect the polymerization process. 
 0073 While the invention has been described with ref erence to preferred embodiments, it will be understood by 
 those skilled in the art that various changes may be made and 
 equivalents may be substituted for elements thereof without departing from the Scope of the invention.

 57 ABSTRACT 
 A supported alpha-olefin polymerization catalyst com 
 position is synthesized by reacting (1) a slurry of a solid 
 catalyst carrier in a non-polar solvent, e.g., hexane, with a dialkyl organomagnesium composition; (2) contacting 
 the slurry of step (1) with a hydroxyl group-containing 
 compound, e.g., an alcohol; (3) contacting the slurry of 
 step (2) with at least one transition metal compound; (4) removing the non-polar solvent to obtain a dry-flowing powder; and, (5) activating the powder with trimethyl 
 aluminum. The resulting catalyst composition is ex tremely active in polymerizing C2-C10 alpha-olefins and 
 exhibits very good higher (C3-C10) alpha-olefin incor poration properties.

 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 
 1. Field of the Invention 
 The present invention relates to a method for poly merizing alpha-olefins, a catalyst for such a polymeriza 
 tion method and a method for producing such a cata lyst. In particular, the present invention relates to a catalyst, and a method for preparation thereof, which produces linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) 
 having a narrow molecular weight distribution, as evi denced by relatively low values of melt flow ratio, 
 (MFR), and low hexane extractables, suitable for film and injection molding applications. The invention is also directed to a highly productive polymerization 
 process carried out with the catalyst of the invention. 2. Description of the Prior Art Linear low density polyethylene polymers possess properties which distinguish them from other polyeth ylene polymers, such as homopolymers of polyethyl 
 ene. Certain of these properties are described in Ander 
 son et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,076,698. 
 Karol et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,302,566, describe a pro cess for producing linear low density polyethylene pol 
 ymers in a gas phase, fluid bed reactor. 
 Graff, U.S. Pat. No. 4,173,547, Stevens et al., U.S. Pat. 
 No. 3,787,384, Strobel et al, U.S. Pat. No. 4,148,754, and 
 Ziegler, deceased, et al, U.S. Pat. No. 4,063,009, each describe various polymerization processes suitable for producing forms of polyethylene other than linear low density polyethylene, per se. 
 Graff, U.S. Pat. No. 4,173,547, describes a supported catalyst obtained by treating a support with both an organoaluminum compound and an organomagnesium compound followed by contacting this treated support with a tetravalent titanium compound. 
 Stevens et al., U.S. Pat. No. 3,787,384, and Strobel et al, U.S. Pat. No. 4,148,754, describe a catalyst prepared by first reacting a support (e.g., silica containing reac tive hydroxyl groups) with an organomagnesium com pound (e.g., a Grignard reagent) and then combining 
 this reacted support with a tetravalent titanium com pound. According to the teachings of both of these patents, no unreacted organomagnesium compound is present when the reacted support is contacted with the tetravalent titanium compound. Ziegler, deceased, et al, U.S. Pat. No. 4,063,009, de scribe a catalyst which is the reaction product of an organomagnesium compound (e.g., an alkylmagnesium 
 halide) with a tetravalent titanium compound. The reac tion of the organomagnesium compound with the tetra Valent titanium compound takes place in the absence of a support material. A vanadium-containing catalyst, used in conjunction with triisobutylaluminum as a co-catalyst, is disclosed 
 by W.L. Carrick et al in Journal of American Chemical Society, Volume 82, page 1502 (1960) and Volume 83, page 2654 (1961). Nowlin et al, U.S. Pat. No. 4,481,301, disclose a sup ported alpah-olefin polymerization catalyst composi tion prepared by reacting a support containing OH groups with a stoichiometric excess of an organomag nesium composition, with respect to the OH groups 10

 content, and then reacting the product with a tetrava lent titanium compound. 
 Dombro, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,378,304 and 4,458,058, disclose an olefin polymerization catalyst composition synthesized by sequentially reacting: (1) a porous Sup port with a Group IIA organometallic compound, e.g., 
 a dialkylmagnesium; (2) the product of (1) with water or a hydrocarbyl alcohol, e.g., methanol; (3) the product of (2) with a transition metal compound or compounds. The product of the synthesis reaction is activated with a co-catalyst which is a Group IA, IIa, IIIA and/or IIB organometallic compound, including hydrogen. Suit able co-catalysts are n-butylithium, diethylmagnesium, trisobutylaluminum and diethylaluminum chloride. 
 Best, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,558,024, 4,558,025 and 4,579,835, disclose olefin polymerization catalyst com positions prepared by reacting together a porous partic 
 ulate material, an organic magnesium compound, an oxygen-containing compound, a transition metal com pound, e.g., a titanium compound (the U.S. Pat. No. 
 4,558,024) or a vanadium compound (the U.S. Pat. No. 4,579,835), and a co-catalyst. Some of the catalyst com positions of Best also include an acyl halide (e.g., see the 
 U.S. Pat. No. 4,579,835 and the U.S. Pat No. 4,558,025). When the LLDPE resins are fabricated into injec tion-molded products, it is imperative to assure that such products are not susceptible to warping or shrink 
 ing. As is known to those skilled in the art, the degree of warping or shrinking can be predicted from the molecu lar weight distribution of the resins. Resins having rela tively narrow molecular weight distribution produce injection-molded products exhibiting a minimum amount of warping or shrinkage. Conversely, resins having relatively broad molecular weight distribution produce injection-molded products more likely to un 
 dergo warping or shrinkage. One of the measures of the 
 molecular weight distribution of the resin is melt flow ratio (MFR), the ratio of high melt flow index (HLMI or I21) to melt index (I2) for a given resin. The melt flow 
 ratio is believed to be an indication of the molecular 
 weight distribution of the polymer, the higher the MFR 
 value, the broader the molecular weight distribution. Resins having relatively low MFR values, e.g., of about 20 to 50, have relatively narrow molecular weight dis tribution. Additionally, LLDPE resins having such relatively low MFR values produce films of better strength properties than resins with high MFR values. Many catalyst systems exhibit a tendency to produce 
 resins whose MFR values, although initially low, in 
 crease with increased concentration of the catalyst acti vator, also known as a co-catalyst, such as various alu minum alkyls. Under certain circumstances, e.g., to improve catalyst productivity and/or comonomer in corporation, it is desirable to increase the catalyst acti vator concentration without substantially affecting the 
 resin MFR. 
 Another important property of LLDPE resins, man ufactured into products coming into contact with arti cles subject to FDA regulations, e.g., foodstuffs, is hex 
 ane extractables which is a measure of the amount of 
 low molecular weight and/or highly branched polymer fractions capable of being extracted from the manufac tured products, e.g., plastic food containers, by hexane extraction. The FDA imposed strict regulations on the amounts of allowable hexane extractables in such plastic products. 
 Thus, Allen et al, European Patent Office (EPO) Application No. 87300536.1, published on Aug. 5, 1987, 4,849,389 3 
 as publication No. 0231102, disclose an alpha-olefin polymerization catalyst composition activated with trimethylaluminum which produces polymers having 
 relatively low values of MRF and low hexane extracta bles. However, the productivity of the polymerization 5 process carried out with such a catalyst composition is 
 lower than that of the process carried out with the same catalyst compositions activated with more commonly 
 used activators, such as triethylaluminum and triso butylaluminum. Accordingly, it is important to provide a catalyst composition capable of producing a alpha-olefin poly 
 mers having relatively narrow molecular weight distri 
 bution (low MFR values) which remains substantially constant with varying amounts of the co-catalyst, and which catalyst composition has high activity. 
 It is therefore a primary object of the present inven tion to provide a high activity catalyst for the polymeri zation of alpha-olefins yielding products of a relatively 20 
 narrow molecular weight distribution which is main tained substantially constant with varying amounts of 
 the co-catalyst concentration. 
 It is another object of the present invention to pro vide a high activity catalyst composition which pro- 25 
 duces alpha-olefin polymers having relatively low hex 
 ane extractables. 
 It is an additional object of the present invention to provide a catalytic process for polymerizing alpha-ole fins which yields linear low density polyethylene of a 30 
 relatively narrow molecular weight distribution at high productivity rates. 
 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 
 A Supported alpha-olefin polymerization catalyst 
 composition of this invention is prepared in a multi-step 
 process. In the first step, a mixture of a solid, porous 
 carrier and a non-polar solvent is contacted with at least one organomagnesium composition of the formula O

 ture is then contacted with at least one transition metal 
 compound soluble in the non-polar solvent. The prod uct is dried and it is activated catalyst composition has very high productivity in the polymerization of alpha 
 olefins, very effective higher comonomer (i.e., C3-C10 alpha-olefin) incorporation properties and it produces 55 polymers having relatively narrow molecular weight 
 distribution and low hexane extractables.

 DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE 
 INVENTION 
 The polymers prepared in the presence of the catalyst 
 compositions of this invention are linear polyethylenes which are homopolymers of ethylene or copolymers of ethylene and higher alpha-olefins. The polymers exhibit 
 relatively low values of melt flow ratio (MFR), as com pared to similar polymers prepared in the presence of previously-known catalyst compositions, e.g., those 
 disclosed by Nowlin et al, U.S. Pat. No. 4,481,301. Thus, the polymers prepared with the catalyst composi 
 tions of this invention are especially suitable for the production of films and injection molding applications. Catalysts produced according to the present inven 
 tion are described below in terms of the manner in 
 which they are made. 
 CATALYST SYNTHESIS 
 The carrier materials are usually inorganic, solid, particulate porous materials which are inert to the other components of the catalyst composition and to the other active components of the reaction system. These carrier 
 materials include such inorganic materials as oxides of 
 silicon and/or aluminum. The carrier materials are used 
 in the form of dry powders having an average particle 
 size of from about 1 micron to about 250 microns, pref erably from about 10 microns to about 150 microns. The carrier materials are also porous and have a surface area of at least about 3 square meters per gram, and prefera bly at least about 50 square meters per gram. The carrier 
 material should be dry, that is, free of absorbed water. Drying of the carrier material can be effected by heat ing at about 100 to about 1000 C. and preferably at 
 about 600 C. When the carrier is silica, it is heated at a temperature of at least 200 C., preferably at about 200 to about 850 C., and most preferably at about 600 C. 
 The carrier material must have at least some active 
 hydroxyl (OH) groups to produce the catalyst composi 
 tion of this invention. 
 In the most preferred embodiment, the carrier is silica which, prior to the use thereof in the first catalyst syn thesis step, has been dehydrated by fluidizing with ni 
 trogen and heating at about 600 C. for about 16 hours 
 to achieve a surface hydroxyl concentration of about 0.7 mmols/gm. The silica of the most preferred embodi ment is a high surface area, amorphous silica (surface area=300 m2/gm; pore volume of 1.65 cm/gm), and it 
 is material marketed under the tradenames of Davison 
 952 or Davison 955 by the Davison Chemical Division of W.R. Grace and Company. The silica is in the form of spherical particles, e.g., as obtained by a spray-drying 
 process. 
 The carrier material is slurried in a non-polar solvent and the resulting slurry is contacted with at least one organomagnesium composition having the empirical 
 formula (I). The slurry of the carrier material in the solvent is prepared by introducing the carrier material 4,849,389 5 
 into the solvent, preferably while stirring, and heating the mixture is about 25 to about 100 C., preferably about 40 to about 60° C. The slurry is then contacted with the aforementioned organomagnesium composi 
 tion, while the heating is continued at the aforemen tioned temperature. The organomagnesium composition has the empirical 
 formula Rin Mg R"", where R and R' are the same or different C4-C12 alkyl groups, preferably C4-C10 alkyl groups, more preferably C4-C8 unsubstituted alkyl groups, and most preferably both R and R' are n-butyl groups, and m and n are each 0, 1 or 2, providing that m-n is equal to the valence of Mg. Suitable non-polar solvents are materials in which all of the reactants used herein, i.e., the organomagnesium composition, the compound of formula (II) and the transition metal compounds are at least partially soluble and which are liquid at reaction temperatures. Preferred non-polar solvents are alkanes, such as hexane, n-hep tane, octane, nonane, and decane, although a variety of other materials including cycloalkanes, such as cyclo 
 hexane, aromatics, such as benzene and ethylbenzene can be employed. The most preferred non-polar solvent 
 is hexane. Prior to use, the non-polar solvent should be purified, such as by percolation through silica gel and 
 /or molecular sieves, to remove traces of water, oxy gen, polar compounds, and other materials capable of adversely affecting catalyst activity. 
 In the most preferred embodiment of the synthesis of this catalyst it is important to add only such an amount of the organomagnesium composition that will be deposited-physically or chemically--onto the support since any excess of the organomagnesium composition 
 in the solution may react with other synthesis chemi cals, and precipitate outside of the support. The carrier drying temperature affects the number of sites on the carrier available for the organomagnesium composi tion-the higher the drying temperature the lower the 
 number of sites. Thus, the exact molar ratio of the or ganomagnesium composition to the hydroxyl groups 
 will vary and must be determined on a case-by-case basis to assure that only so much of the ogranomag nesium composition is added to the solution as will be deposited onto the support without leaving any excess of the organomagnesium composition in the solution. 
 Furthermore, it is believed that the molar amout of the organomagnesium composition deposited onto the sup port is greater than the molar content of the hydroxyl groups on the support. Thus, the molar ratios given below are intended to serve only as an approximate guideline and the exact amount of the organomag nesium composition in this embodiment must be con trolled by the functional limitation discussed above, i.e., it must not be greater than that which can be deposited onto the support. If greater than the amount is added to the solvent, the excess may react with the compound of formula (II), thereby forming a precipitate outside of the support which is detrimental in the synthesis of our catalyst and must be avoided. The amount of the or ganomagnesium composition which is not greater than that deposited onto the support can be determined in any conventional manner, e.g., by adding the or ganomagnesium composition to the slurry of the carrier in the solvent, while stirring the slurry, until the or ganomagnesium composition is detected as a solution in 
 the solvent. 
 For example, for the silica carrier heated at about 200 to about 850 C., the amount of the organomag O 
 15

 nesium composition added to the slurry is such that the molar ratio of Mg to the hydroxyl groups (OH) on the 
 solid carrier is about 1:1 to about 6:1, preferably about 2:1 to about 4:1, more preferably about 2.5:1 to about 3.5:1 and most preferably about 3:1, depending upon the 
 temperature at which the carrier material was dried. The organomagnesium composition dissolves in the 
 non-polar solvent to form a solution. 
 It is also possible to add such an amount of the or ganomagnesium composition which is in excess of that 
 which will be deposited onto the support and then re move, e.g., by filtration and washing, any excess of the organomagnesium composition. However, this alterna 
 tive is less desirable than the most preferred embodi 
 ment described above. 
 After the addition of the organomagnesium composi tion to the slurry is completed, the slurry is contacted 
 with at least one compound of the formula (II) 
 R'-OH (II) 
 where R' is a C1-C10 alkyl group or a C1-C10 haloge nated alkyl group, preferably R' is a C1-C10 alkyl 
 group, more preferably a C1-C4 normal alkyl group or a C1-C4 halogenated normal alkyl group, and most preferably R' is an ethyl group. Thus, the compound of 
 formula (II) is preferably an alcohol and most prefera bly ethanol. The amount of the compound of formula (II) used in this synthesis step is sufficient to convert substantially all of the magnesium alkyl (Mg-R or 
 MgR) groups on the carrier to magnesium alkoxy 
 (MgO R') groups. In a preferred embodiment, the 
 amount of the formula (II) compound added is such that substantially no excess thereof is present in the non polar solvent after substantially all of the magnesium alkyl groups are converted to the magnesium alkoxy 
 groups on the carrier to prevent the reaction of the 
 formula (II) compound with the transition metal com pound outside of the carrier. This synthesis step is con ducted at about 25 to about 65° C., preferably at about 30 to about 55 C., and most preferably at about 30 to 
 about 40 C. 
 After the addition of the formula (II) compound is completed, the slurry is contacted with at least one transition metal compound soluble in the non-polar solvent. This synthesis step is conducted at about 25 to about 65° C., preferably at about 30 to about 55 C., and most preferably at about 30 to about 40° C. In a preferred embodiment, the amount of the transition metal compound added is not greater than that which 
 can be deposited onto the carrier. The exact molar ratio 
 of Mg to the transition metal and of the transition metal to the hydroxyl groups of the carrier will therefore vary (depending, e.g., on the carrier drying temperature) and 
 must be determined on a case-by-case basis. For exam 
 ple, for the silica carrier heated at about 200 to 850 C., the amount of the transition metal compound is such that the molar ratio of the transition metal, derived from the transition metal compound, to the hydroxyl groups of the carrier is about 1 to about 2.0, preferably about 1.5 to about 2.0 and the molar ratio of Mg to the transi tion metal is about 1 to about 3, preferably about 2 to about 3. We found that these molar ratios produce a catalyst composition which produces resins having 
 relatively low melt flow ratio (MFR) values of about 20 
 to about 35. As is known to those skilled in the art, such resins can be utilized to produce high strength films and 4,849,389 7 
 injection molding products which are resistant to warp ing or shrinking. 
 Suitable transition metal compounds used herein are compounds of metals of Groups IVA, VA, VIA or VIII of the Periodic Chart of the Elements, as published by 5 the Fisher Scientific Company, Catalog No. 5-702-10, 1978, providing that such compounds are soluble in the non-polar solvents. Non-limiting examples of such com 
 pounds are titanium and vanadium halides, e.g., tita nium tetrachloride, TiCl4, vanadium tetrachloride, 10 VCl4, vanadium oxytrichloride, VOCI3, titanium and 
 vanadium alkoxides, wherein the alkoxide moiety has a 
 branched or unbranched alkyl radical of 1 to about 20 carbon atoms, preferably 1 to about 6 carbon atoms. The preferred transition metal compounds are titanium 15 compounds, preferably tetravalent titanium com pounds. The most preferred titanium compound is tita 
 nium tetrachloride. 
 Mixtures of such transition metal compounds may also be used and generally no restrictions are imposed 20 on the transition metal compounds which may be in cluded. Any transition metal compound that may be used alone may also be used in conjunction with other transition metal compounds. After the addition of the transition metal compound is completed, the non-polar 25 
 solvent is slowly removed, e.g., by distillation or evapo ration. We found that the temperature at which the non-polar solvent is removed from the synthesis mix ture affects the productivity of the resulting catalyst composition. Lower solvent removal temperatures pro- 30 duce catalyst compositions which are substantially 
 more active than those produced with higher solvent removal temperatures. For this reason, it is preferred to 
 remove the non-polar solvent at about 40 to about 65 C., preferably at about 45 to about 55° C. and most 35 preferably at about 50° C. by drying, distillation or evaporation or any other conventional means. The resulting free-flowing powder, referred to herein as a catalyst precursor, is combined with the trimethyl 
 aluminum (TMA) activator. We found that the combi- 40 nation of the precursor of this invention with the TMA activator produces an alpha-olefin polymerization cata lyst composition having very high activity, as com pared to a catalyst composition comprising the same 
 catalyst precursor and other, more conventional cata- 45 lyst activators, such as triethylaluminum (TEAL). This is additionally surprising and unexpected because other 
 workers in this field found that, although TMA exhibits some advantages with other catalyst precursor, it de creases the activity of such precursors, e.g., See Allen et 50 al, EPO Application No. 87300536.7, publication No. 0 231 102, published Aug. 8, 1987. The catalyst composition of this invention, activated with TMA, also exhibits extremely good higher alpha olefin (i.e., C3-C10 alpha-olefin) incorporation proper- 55 ties when it is used to polymerize ethylene with such higher alpha-olefins. The TMA activator is used in an amount which is at least effective to promote the poly merization activity of the solid catalyst component of 
 this invention. The amount of the TMA activator is 60 
 sufficient to give an Al:transition metal molar ratio in the catalyst composition of about 15:1 to about 1000:1, preferably about 20:1 to about 300:1, and most prefera bly about 25:1 to about 100:1. Without wishing to be bound by any theory of opera- 65 bility, it is believed that the catalyst composition of this invention is produced by chemically impregnating the support with catalyst components sequentially added to 8 
 the slurry of the carrier in the non-polar solvent. There fore, all of the catalysts synthesis chemical ingredients 
 must be soluble in the non-polar solvent used in the synthesis. The order of addition of the reagents may also be important since the catalyst synthesis procedure 
 is predicated on the chemical reaction between the chemical ingredients sequentially added to the non 
 polar solvent (a liquid) and the solid carrier material or a catalyst intermediate supported by such a material (a 
 solid). Thus, the reaction is a solid-liquid reaction. For example, the catalyst synthesis procedure must be con 
 ducted in such a manner as to avoid the reaction of two 
 or more reagents in the non-polar solvent to form a reaction product insoluble in the non-polar solvent out side of the solid catalyst support. Such an insoluble reaction product would be incapable of reacting with 
 the carrier or the catalyst intermediate and therefore would not be incorporated onto the solid support of the catalyst composition. 
 The catalyst precursors of the present invention are 
 prepared in the substantial absence of water, oxygen, and other catalyst poisons. Such catalyst poisons can be excluded during the catalyst preparation steps by any 
 well known methods, e.g., by carrying out the prepara tion under an atmosphere of nitrogen, argon or other inert gas. An inert gas purge can serve the dual purpose of excluding external contaminants during the prepara tion and removing undesirable reaction by-products resulting from the preparation of catalyst precursor. 
 Purification of the non-polar solvent employed in the catalyst synthesis is also helpful in this regard. 
 The catalyst may be activated in situ by adding the TMA activator and catalyst separately to the polymeri 
 zation medium. It is also possible to combined the cata 
 lyst and the activator before the introduction thereof into the polymerization medium, e.g., for up to about 2 
 hours prior to the introduction thereof into the poly merization medium at a temperature of from about 
 - 40 to about 100° C. 
 POLYMERIZATION 
 Alpha-olefins are polymerized with the catalysts pre 
 pared according to the present invention by any suitable process. Such processes include polymerizations car 
 ried out in suspension, in solution or in the gas phase. Gas phase polymerization reactions are preferred, e.g., 
 those taking place in stirred bed reactors and, espe cially, fluidized bed reactors. The molecular weight of the polymer may be con trolled in a known manner, e.g., by using hydrogen. With the catalysts produced according to the present 
 invention, molecular weight may be suitably controlled with hydrogen when the polymerization is carried out a relatively low temperature, e.g., from about 30 to 
 about 105 C. This control of molecular weight may be evidenced by a measurable positive change in melt index (I2) of the polymer produced. 
 The molecular weight distribution of the polymers prepared in the presence of the catalysts of the present 
 invention, as expressed by the melt flow ratio (MFR) values, varies from about 20 to about 35, preferably about 20 to about 30, for LLDPE products having a density of about 0.900 to about 0.940, and an I2 (melt index) of about 0.5 to about 100. Conversely, HDPE products, produced with the catalysts of this invention, 
 have a density of about 0.940 to about 0.965, MFR values of about 20 to about 35, preferably about 20 to 
 about 30, and I2 values of about 0.5 to about 100. As is 4,849,389 9 
 known to those skilled in the art, such MFR values are indicative of a relatively narrow molecular weight dis tribution of the polymer. As is also known to those skilled in the art, such MFR values are indicative of the polymers especially suitable for injection molding appli 
 cations since the polymers having such MFR values exhibit relatively low amounts of warpage and shrink age on cooling of the injection molded products. The relatively low MFR values of the polymers prepared 
 with the catalysts of this invention also indicate that they are suitable for the preparation of various film products since such films are likely to have excellent strength properties. MFR is defined herein as the ratio of the high load melt index (HLMI or I21) divided by the melt index, i.e.g., 
 I2 MFR as -- 
 The catalysts prepared according to the present in 
 vention are highly active and may have an activity of at least about 1-14 kilograms of polymer per gram of cata lyst per 100 psi of ethylene in about 1 hour. The linear polyethylene polymers prepared in accor 
 dance with the present invention are homopolymers of ethylene or copolymers of ethylene with one or more C3-C10 alpha-olefins. Thus, copolymers having two 
 monomeric units are possible as well as terpolymers having three monomeric units. Particular examples of such polymers include ethylene/1-butene copolymers, ethylene/1-hexene copolymers, ethylene/1-octene co polymers, ethylene/4-methyl-1-pentene copolymers, ethylene/1-butene/1-hexane terpolymers, ethylene/- propylene/1-hexane terpolymers and ethylene/- propylene/1-butene terpolymers. When propylene is 
 employed as a comonomer, the resulting linear low density polyethylene polymer preferably has at least 
 one other alpha-olefin comonomer having at least four carbon atoms in an amount of at least 1 percent by weight of the polymer. Accordingly, ethylene/propy lene copolymers are possible, but not preferred. The 
 most preferred comonomer is 1-hexene. 10

 features of the invention. However, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the specific reactants and reaction conditions used in the Examples do not limit the scope of the invention. 
 EXAMPLE 1. 
 (Catalyst Synthesis) 
 20.0 grams of Davison grade 955 silica which had 
 been heated to 600 C. for about 16 hours under a dry nitrogen purge was slurried in about 200 (milliters) mls 
 of dry hexane contained in a 4-neck 500 ml round bot tom flask kept under a continuous nitrogen purge and 
 fitted with an overhead stirrer and a reflux condenser. 
 The slurry was heated to and maintained are reflux, and 52.4 mls of dibutylmagnesium (DBM), 0.77 Molar solu tion in heptane, was added dropwise to the slurry (about 
 15 minutes) and the reflux continued for one hour. Next, 
 4.15 mls of absolute ethanol diluted in about 40 mls of 
 dry hexane was added dropwise to the slurry (about 15 
 minutes) and reflux continued for an additional hour. Finally, 2.4 mils of TiCl4 diluted in about 40 mls of dry hexane was added dropwise, the reflux was continued 
 for an additional hour, and solvents were removed by distillation and dried at about 85°-90° C. to yield 21.3 grams of a dry, free-flowing powder. The resulting 
 catalyst precursor contained 1.31 mmols of Mg/gram of the precursor, 0.731 mmols of Ti/gram of the precursor, and 2.82 mmols of Cl/gram of the precursor.

 The linear low density polyethylene polymers pro duced in accordance with the present invention prefera bly contain at least about 80 percent by weight of ethyl

 A particularly desirable method for producing linear low density polyethylene polymers according to the 
 present invention is in a fluid bed reactor. Such a reac tor and means for operating it are described by Levine et al, U.S. Pat. No. 4,011,382, Karol et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,302,566 and by Nowlin et al, U.S. Pat No. 4,481,301, the entire contents of all of which are incorporated 60 
 65 EXAMPLES 8-14 
 (Polymerization Process) 
 The catalyst precursors of Examples 1-7 were com bined with triethylaluminum (TEAL) or with trimeth ylaluminum (TMA) catalyst activators to produce ethylene/1-hexane copolymers. A typical polymeriza 
 tion was carried out as follows with the catalyst of Example 1. At about 50° C., and under a slow nitrogen purge, a 1.6 liter stainless steel autoclave, previously 4,849,389 11 
 heated to about 80° C. under purge of dry nitrogen, was filled with 400 mls of dry hexane, 200 mls of dry 1-hex ane and 3.0 mls of triethylaluminum (25 wt % in hex 
 ane). The reactor was closed, and hydrogen was intro duced to raise the internal pressure to 23 psi. The con tents of the reactor was stirred at 900 rpm and the tem perature was increased to about 70° C. The reactor was filled with ethylene to a total pres sure of about 120 psi and then 0.1637 grams of Example 1 catalyst precursor, slurried in about 25 mols of hexane, was added to the reactor. The reactor temperature was adjusted to 80 C. and the reactor pressure was main tained with ethylene. The polymerization was continued for 50 minutes. 200 grams of polyethylene were obtained. The polymer 
 contained 26.5 mole % 1-hexane and it had the follow 
 ing properties: I2 =0.58; I21 = 16.3; I21/I2 = 28.1; den sity = 0.926 gm/cc. The productivies of the catalyst compositions were 
 determined as a function of the alcohol used in the synthesis of the catalyst precursor and of the catalyst 
 activators. The results are illustrated graphically in 
 FIG.1. As is evident from FIG. 1, trichloroethanol produced the most active catalyst precursor, with the 
 TEAL or TMA activators. However, the trichloroe thanol-based-catalyst system decayed relatively rapidly 
 (half-life of about 40 minutes). The data of FIG. 1 indi cates that the TMA activator produces catalyst compo sitions having 2-3 times greater productivities than the 
 TEAL activator used to activate the same catalyst pre 
 CSOS. 
 EXAMPLE 15 
 (Comparative Catalyst Precursor Synthesis) 
 A comparative catalyst precursor was synthesized according to the teachings of Karol et al, European patent application No. 84103441.6, filed on Mar. 28, 
 1984, Publication No. 0 120 503, published on Oct. 3, 1984. This catalyst precursor is substantially equivalent 
 to that of Karol et al, as disclosed in the aforementioned Published European Patent Application. It is also sub stantially equivalent to the precursors prepared by the following representative procedure. 
 (a) Impregnation of Support with Precursor 
 In a 12 liter flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer were placed 41.8 g (0.439 mol) of anhydrous MgCl2 and 2.5 liters of tetrahydrofuran (THF). To this mixture, 
 29.0 (0.146 mol) of TiCl30.33 AlCl3 were added drop wise over a hour period. The mixture was then heated at 60° C. for another hour in order to completely 
 dissolve the material. 
 Five hundred grams (500 g) of silica were dehydrated by heating at a temperature of 600 C. and slurried in 3 liters of isopentane. The slurry was stirred while 186 ml of a 20 percent by weight solution of triethylaluminum 
 in hexane was added thereto over a hour period. The resulting mixture was then dried under a nitrogen purge at 60° C. over a period of about 4 hours to provide a dry, free-flowing powder containing 5.5 percent by 
 weight of the aluminum alkyl. 
 The treated silica was then added to the solution 
 prepared as above. The resulting slurry was stirred for hour and then dried under a nitrogen purge at 60° C. over a period of about 4 hours to provide a dry, impreg nated, free-flowing powder. (b) Preparation of Partially Activated Precursor (i) The silica-impregnated precursor composition 
 prepared in accordance with step (a) was slurried in 3 10

 liters of anhydrous isopentane and stirred while a 20 percent by weight solution of diethylaluminum chloride 
 in anhydrous hexane was added thereto over a hour period. The diethylaluminum chloride (DEAC) solu 
 tion was employed in an amount sufficient to provide 0.36 mols of this compound per mol of tetrahydrofuran 
 (THF) in the precursor. After addition of the diethylal 
 uminum chloride was completed, stirring was contin ued for an additional to hour while a 20 percent by weight solution of tri-n-hexylaluminum (TNHAL) in 
 anhydrous hexane was added in an amount sufficient to provide 0.25 mols of this compound per mol of tetrahy 
 drofuran in the precursor. The mixture was then dried under a nitrogen purge at a temperature of 56-10 C. over a period of about 4 hours to provide a dry, free flowing powder. This material was stored under dry 
 nitrogen until it was needed. 
 EXAMPLE 16 
 (Preparation of LLDPE Product. With TEAL-Activated Precursor of Example 15(b)) 
 The partially activated comparative catalyst precur 
 sor composition of Example 15(b), with the molar ratios 
 of DEAC/THF = 0.36 and TNHAL/THF=0.25, was 
 used to prepare LLDPE product in a 1.6 liter autoclave 
 reactor. Reaction conditions were similar to those in 
 Example 9. The productivity was about 4,000 grams 
 PE/gr cat/hour. 
 EXAMPLE 7 
 (Preparation of LLDPE Proccuts with TMA-Activated Comparative Precursor of Example 
 15(b)) 
 The partially activated comparative precursor com 
 position of Example 15(b) with the molar ratios of 
 DEAC/THF = 0.36 and TNHAL/THF = 0.25, was used to prepare LLDPE product in a 1.6 liter autoclave reactor. Reaction conditions were substantially equiva lent to those of Example 9, except that a TMA activator was used in place of TEAL. Catalyst productivity was 
 about 4,100 gms PE/gm cat/hour. 
 EXAMPLE 1.8 
 (Effect of Increasing Amounts of Cocatalyst on MFR of Polymers) 
 To determine the effect of increasing the amount of TMA and TEAL cocatalyst on the MFR of the poly mers produced with the resulting catalyst compositions, the performance of a catalyst precursor substantially 
 similar to that of Example 1 was compared to that of the comparative catalyst precursor of Example 15b, both 
 activated with varying amounts of the TMA or TEAL cocatalysts. The polymerizations were conducted in the 
 manner summarized below: 
 400 mls of dry hexane was added to a 1.6 liter auto clave at 56' C. while under a slow nitrogen purge. 200 mils (135 grams) of 1-hexane was added, followed by TEAL or TMA. Various amounts of cocatalyst were added to give the concentration ranges shown in FIGS. 5 and 6. Concentration of co-catalyst is expressed as ppm based on the total weight of hexane and 1-hexene used in the polymerization. The reactor was closed, and 
 hydrogen was added from a calibrated hoke bomb, the contents were stirred at 900 rpm and the temperature was increased to 70° C. Ethylene was added to the autoclave to 120 psi and about 0.03–0.06 grams of the 4,849,389 13 catalyst precursor was injected with ethylene overpres 
 sure. The temperature was maintained at 80 C. and 150-200 grams of copolymer was produced in 50-60 
 minutes. The effect of increasing amounts of the TMA or TEAL activator on the MFR of the polymers is shown graphically in FIGS. 5 and 6. 
 EXAMPLES 19-20 
 Polymerizations were carried out similarly to Exam 5 
 ples 9-14, except that 450 mls of hexane and 150 mls of 10 1-hexene were used. TEAL (3 mls of a 25 wt % solution in hexane) was used as the catalyst activator. 14 
 molecule is inserted 152 times for every 1-hexene mole cule that is inserted into the polymer molecule. 
 Molecular Weight Distribution (MWD) of Polymers 
 The effect of catalyst composition and cocatalysts on 
 the MWD of the copolymers is summarized in FIGS. 2 
 and 3. FIG. 2 shows that the MFR for the ethanol-based catalyst of Example 1 depends on both copolymer com position and cocatalyst type. For example, the MFR 
 increases from about 29 to 31 (TEAL) as the 1-hexene content increases. from 2.4 mole% (density of 0.926 gms/cc) to 4.0 mole % (density of 0.914 gms/cc). Over

 DISCUSSION OF EXAMPLES 
 The reactivity of each catalyst used to copolymerize ethylene with 1-hexene is dependent on the catalyst composition. The 1-hexene response is expressed below as a reactivity ratio, r1, defined by the equation: 
 where f=(CE/CH)copolymer 
 F=(CE/CH)monomer 
 r=kEE/kEH In the above formulae, subscripts E and H designate ethylene and hexene, respectively. Thus, lower values of r indicate improved 1-hexene incorporation proper 
 ties. 
 Table III summarizes the catalyst reactivity ratios 
 with 1-hexene as a function of alcohol used or a transi tion metal compound on the precursor synthesis and 
 activator.

 The data of Table III indicates that the catalysts pre pared with all of the alcohols, except 2,2,2-trichlorore thanol, react relatively poorly with 1-hexene in the presence of TEAL as the activator (r1 = 196) indicating that an ethylene molecule is inserted 196 times into the polymer molecule for every 1-hexene molecule that is inserted during the polymerization reaction. In the pres ence of the TMA activator, the reactivity ratio is signifi cantly lower (r1 = 1529), indicating improved (about 22% better) 1-hexene incorporation properties with the TMA-activated catalyst precursor, i.e., an ethylene 25

 65 the same range, copolymers prepared with TMA as 
 cocatalyst have MFR values from about 27 to 29. The data therefore indicates that, unexpectedly, TMA pro vides polymers with a narrower MWD as indicated by 
 MFR values that are about 1-2 MFR units lower com 
 pared to polymers prepared with TEAL-activated cata lysts. 
 FIG. 3 shows a similar trend for other catalysts (of Examples 1, 2, 6 and 7) prepared with different alcohols with TEAL or TMA as a cocatalyst. However, the copolymer prepared with an alcohol-free catalyst pro 
 vided the broadest MWD, as indicated by MFR values of about 38 to about 42. Copolymers produced with catalysts synthesized with alcohol gave MFR values ranging from about 27 to about 35, depending on alco hol type and cocatalyst. Thus, catalysts based on etha nol and TMA give copolymers with the narrowest 
 MWD. Catalysts based on methanol and 2,2,2-trichloro ethanol produce copolymers with MFR values in the 32-37 range depending on density and cocatalyst. At the same density, these catalysts give products with MFR values about 2-6 units higher than copolymers prepared with the ethanol-based catalysts. 
 Comparison of Titanium and Vanadium Based Catalysts of Examples 6 and 6a 
 Two catalysts based on 2,2,2-trichloroethanol were prepared, one with TiCl4 (Example 6) and one with VOCl3 (Example 6A). The comparison of the effect of the transition metal on the catalyst properties is summa 
 rized in Table III. 
 The data in Tables II and III indicate that the catalyst 
 based on titanium is about 7 times more active and in 
 corporate 1-hexene about 2.5 times more slowly than 
 the vanadium-based catalyst. However, the vanadium based catalyst provides a copolymer with a relatively 
 broad MWD. 
 Effect of Drying Temperature 
 To test the effect, if any, of drying temperature on the catalyst properties, a catalyst was prepared in which the 
 temperature used to remove the solvents was lowered from 90° C. (Example 1) to 55° C. Aside from the differ ent drying temperatures, the catalyst synthesis was car ried out substantially as in Example 1. The results are 
 summarized in FIG. 4. 4,849,389 15 
 The data indicate that the productivity of this catalyst precursor is particularly sensitive to the drying condi 
 tions. The precursor dried at 55 C. is about 25 percent more productive than the precursor dried at 90° C. Consequently, to maintain high catalyst productivity, 5 
 the catalyst precursor should preferably be dried at 
 40-65 C. 
 Effect of Increasing Activator Amounts 
 The data of FIG. 5 indicates that increased content of 10 
 TEAL produces catalyst compositions which produce 
 polymers of increasing MFR values for both, the inven tive and the comparative catalyst precursor composi 
 tions. The data of FIG. 6, however, indicates that in creased content of TMA produces catalyst composi tions which produce polymers of substantially constant 
 MFR values for both the inventive and the comparative catalyst precursor compositions. 
 The ability to produce polymers of substantially con 
 stant low MFR values regardless of the cocatalyst con tent is important in order to produce the same polyeth ylene product with superior physical properties, such as low shrinking and warpage for injection molding appli 
 cations. 25

 PREPARATION OF HOMO- AND COPOLYMERS 
 OF PROPENE USINGAZEGLER-NATA 
 CATALYST SYSTEM 
 The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of homopolymers of propene and copoly 
 mers of propene with minor amounts of other C2-C12-a. monoolefins, in particular C2-C6-a-monoolefins, by polymerization, in particular dry-phase polymerization, 
 of the monomer or monomers at from 20' to 160 C, in particular from 50 to 120° C., and under from 1 to 100 in particular from 20 to 70, bar using a Ziegler-Natta catalyst system consisting of 
 (1) a titanium component which contains titanium, magnesium, chlorine and a benzenecarboxylic acid de 
 rivative on a carrier, (2) an aluminum component of the formula 
 AR3, 
 where R is alkyl of not more than 8, in particular not 
 more than 4, carbon atoms, and (3) a silane component of the formula 
 RSi(OR)4-, 
 where R1 is an aryl, alkylaryl or alkyl radical of not more than 16, preferably not more than 10, carbon atoms, in particular phenyl, tolyl or ethylphenyl, R2 is alkyl of not more than 15, preferably not more than 8, in particular not more than 4, carbon atoms and n is from 0 to 3, preferably from 0 to 2, in particular 1 to 2, with the provisos that the atomic ratio of titanium from the titanium component (1) to aluminum from the alumi num component (2) is from 1:10 to 1:800, in particular 
 from 1:20 to 1:200, and the molar ratio of aluminum component (2) to silane component (3) is from 1:0.03 to 1:08, in particular from 1:0.05 to 1:0.5. Polymerization processes of this type are known; their special feature compared with other similar pro cesses is the special embodiment of the catalyst system, and the processes disclosed in European Laid-Open application Nos. 17,895 and 144,021, European Pat. No. 
 45,977, Australian Pat. No. 543,049 and British Pat. No. 2,143,834 may be mentioned as prototypes for the pres 
 ent case. 
 The special embodiments of the catalyst systems are produced in order to achieve certain aims, such as the following: 
 The catalyst system should be easy to prepare and give an increased yield of polymer having a very large 
 isotactic fraction. In addition, particularly because of the thermodynamics of the procedure, easy molecular weight regulation, in particular with hydrogen, is of great importance. 
 The catalyst system should moreover produce poly mers having special morphological properties, for ex 
 ample uniform particle size and/or smaller fractions of very fine particles and/or a high bulk density. In addi tion to these parameters which are important for con trolling the polymerization systems, working up the 
 polymers and/or processing the latter, a low halogen content in the polymer is of importance, particularly with regard to corrosion problems; this can be achieved by increasing the polymer yield and/or by means of a catalyst system which contains very little halogen. 
 Some of these aims can be achieved by the prior art only by means of very expensive processes, as is the 2 
 case, for example, with the process according to U.S. 
 Pat. No. 4,399,054, or when other aims are neglected. For example, British Pat. No. 2,049,709 discloses a process in which a magnesium halide, a titanium halide and an electron donor are applied to a metal oxide car rier. However, the polymer obtained has a compara

 65 tively low isotacticity. 
 European Laid-Open application Nos. 14,523 and 
 171,200 and British Pat. Nos. 2,101,609 and 2,101,611 describe catalyst systems whose titanium component is 
 obtained by treating a solid, inorganic oxide with an organic magnesium compound, a Lewis base and tita 
 nium tetrachloride, it being necessary in addition to use a halogenating agent which is not titanium tetrachloride and/or an organic compound of the metals boron, alu 
 minum, silicon or tin or a boron trihalide or a halogen containing alcohol. Despite an expensive and tedious preparation procedure, the productivity of the corre sponding catalyst system is unsatisfactory. 
 U.S. Pat. No. 4,467,044 discloses a catalyst system which contains, as a titanium component, a silica car rier, a magnesium halide and/or manganese halide, a 
 titanium halide and an electron donor. In order to ob tain catalyst systems having relatively high productiv 
 ity, additional treatment with an organometallic com pound of a metal of groups I to III of the periodic table is indispensable here. However, the productivity and stereospecificity of the catalysts prepared in this manner 
 are, in absolute terms, low. The known processes are thus unsatisfactory, in par ticular with regard to high isotacticity and good mor phology coupled with good productivity. It is an object of the present invention to provide a titanium component which, compared with the prior art processes, has high productivity and is at the same time capable of giving polymers having high isotacticity and good morphology. 
 We have found that this object is achieved by a cata lyst system which contains a titanium component (1) prepared in three stages in a particular manner from (I) magnesium chloride, (II) a certain alkanol, (III) a cer tain carrier comprising finely divided inorganic oxide carrier material which has been pretreated with an al kylchlorosilane, (IV) titanium tetrachloride and (V) a specially selected phthalic acid derivative. The present invention accordingly relates to a pro cess for the preparation of homopolymers of propene and copolymers of propene with minor amounts of other C2-C12-a-monoolefins, in particular C2-C6-a- monoolefins, by polymerization, in particular dry-phase polymerization, of the monomer or monomers at from 20 to 160 C., in particular from 50 to 120° C., under from 1 to 100, in particular from 20 to 70, bar using a Ziegler-Natta catalyst consisting of 
 (1) a titanium component which contains titanium, magnesium, chlorine and a benzenecarboxylic acid de 
 rivative on a carrier, (2) an aluminum component of the formula 
 AR3, 
 where R is alkyl of not more than 8, in particular not 
 more than 4, carbon atoms, 
 and 
 (3) a silane component of the formula 4,843,132 3 
 where R is an aryl, alkylaryl or alkyl radical of not more than 16, preferably not more than 10, carbon atoms, in particular phenyl, tolyl or ethylphenyl, R2 is 
 alkyl of not more than 15, preferably not more than 8, in 
 particular not more than 4, carbon atoms and n is from 0 to 3, preferably from 0 to 2, in particular 1 or 2, 
 with the provisos that the atomic ratio of titanium from the titanium component (1) to aluminum from the alu minum component (2) is from 1:10 to 1:800, in particular 
 from 1:20 to 1:200, and the molar ratio of aluminum component (2) to silane component (3) is from 1:0.03 to 1:0.8, in particular from 1:0.05 to 1:0.5. In the novel process, the titanium component (1) used 
 is one which is obtained by a method in which first (1.1) in a first stage, a solid-phase intermediate is prepared from (I) finely divided magnesium chloride, (II) a C1-C8 alkanol, preferably a C2-C6-alkanol, in particular a 
 C2-C4-alkanol, (III) a carrier consisting of a finely divided, porous, inorganic oxide carrier material which has a particle diameter of from 1 to 1,000 um, in particular from 10 to 400 um, a pore volume of from 0.3 to 3, in particular from 1 to 2.5, cm/g and a surface area of from 100 to 1,000, in particular from 200 to 400, m2/g, is of the formula SiO2.a Al2O3, where a is from 0 to 2, in particu lar from 0 to 0.5, and has been pretreated with an alkyl chlorosilane of the formula R3mSiCl4-m, where R3 is C1-C10-alkyl, preferably C1-C4-alkyl and m is from 1 to 
 3, preferably 2 or 3, in particular 3, in such a way that 
 either (A) the carrier material and the alkylchlorosilane are combined once or several times, in particular twice, in a liquid inert hydrocarbon, in particular an alkane, with constant thorough mixing at from 20' to 160° C., in particular from 60 to 120° C., a total of from 1 to 50, in particular from 3 to 20, molar parts of the alkylchlorosi lane being used per 10 molar parts of the carrier mate rial, and a total of from 20 to 200, in particular from 40 to 120, molar parts of the hydrocarbon being used per 10 molar parts of the alkylchlorosilane, and the com 
 bined substances are kept at from 20' to 160 C., in particular from 60 to 120 C., for a total of from 0.1 to 5, in particular from 0.4 to 2, hours, and the resulting solid is then isolated as the carrier (III), or (B) the carrier material and the alkylchlorosilane are combined with constant thorough mixing at from 20 to 140 C., in particular from 40 to 100 C., from 5 to 50, in particular from 10 to 40, molar parts of the alkyl chlorosilane being used per 10 molar parts of the carrier material, and the combined substances are kept at a temperature in the stated range for from 0.1 to 5, in particular from 0.4 to 2, hours, and the resulting solid is then isolated as the carrier (III), (IV) titanium tetrachloride and (V) a phthalic acid derivative of the formula

 weight of the titanium tetrachloride being used per 10 parts by weight of the solid-phase intermediate obtained from the first stage, and finally (1.3) in a third stage, the solid-phase intermediate obtained in the second stage is extracted with a liquid inert hydrocarbon, in particular an alkane, until the solid contains from 0.01 to 30, preferably from 0.03 to 20, in particular from 0.05 to 10, 7% by weight of free titanium tetrachloride, and the titanium component (1) 
 is obtained in this manner. Regarding the novel process, the following may be stated specifically: Provided that the defining feature is taken into ac count, the polymerization process as such can be car ried out in virtually all relevant conventional techno logical embodiments, for example as a batchwise, cyclic or, in particular, continuous process, either as a suspen sion polymerization processor, in particular, a dryphase polymerization process. The stated technological em bodiments, i.e. the technological variants of the poly merization of a-monoolefins by the Ziegler-Natta method, are well known from the literature and in prac tice and therefore require no further description. For the sake of completeness, it may be stated that, in the novel process, it is also possible to regulate the molecular weights of the polymers by the relevant con ventional measures, for example using regulators such as, in particular, hydrogen. Regarding the composition of the novel catalysts, the following may be stated specifically: (1) The liquid inert hydrocarbon to be used for the preparation of the titanium component may be a hydro 
 carbon of the type usually combined with titanium com ponents for catalyst systems of the Ziegler-Natta type 
 without causing damage to the catalyst system or its titanium component. Examples of suitable hydrocar bons are pentanes, hexanes, heptanes, gasolines and cyclohexane. 
 The finely divided magnesium chloride (I) likewise to be used may be a relevant conventional one. It should be essentially anhydrous, i.e. its water content should not exceed 1% by weight of the total amount of magne 
 sium chloride. 
 The alkanois (II) to be used for the preparation of the titanium component (1) may be conventional ones; they should advantageously have relatively high purities. Examples of suitable alkanols are ethanol, n-propyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, n-butyl alcohol, isobutyl alcohol and tert-butyl alcohol, n-butanol being particu larly suitable. The carrier (III) furthermore to be used generally contains, as a base material, an aluminosilicate or, in particular, silica; it is important that it has the required properties; it has been found that the relevant conven tional commercial carrier materials which meet the stated specification are suitable. Alkylchlorosilanes suit able for the preparation of the carrier are monoalkyltri chlorosilanes, dialkyldichlorosilanes and trialkyl mono chlorosilanes, trialkylmonochlorosilanes being particu larly suitable and trimethylchlorosilane being preferred. 
 The titanium tetrachloride (IV) likewise to be used for the preparation of the titanium component (1) should be one which is conventionally used in Ziegler Natta catalyst systems. 
 Furthermore, the phthalic acid derivative (V) defined above can be a commercial one; it should advanta geously be very pure. It has been found that phthaloyl dichloride is very particularly suitable for the purpose 10

 according to the invention; however, phthalic anhy dride and the dialkyl phthalates, in particular di-n-butyl 
 phthalate, are also suitable. The alkane to be used for the preparation of the tita nium component (1) in stage (1.3) may likewise be a 
 conventional one; it should advantageously have a rela tively high purity. 
 The preparation of the titanium component (1) is 
 simple and can be carried out by the skilled worker without explanations. Regarding stages (1.1), (1.2) and (1.3), it is merely necessary to state that the isolation of the particular resulting solid is advantageously carried 
 out by filtration under suction, which in stage (1.1) should advantageously be followed by washing with a liquid, inert hydrocarbon until the latter no longer ab 
 sorbs any titanium tetrachloride. It has been found that it may also be advantageous if the solid-phase reaction 
 product obtained in the second substance (1.1.2.a) is isolated before being used in the third substage (1.1.3), for example by evaporation to dryness. 
 (2) Suitable aluminum components (2) of the stated 
 formula are the relevant conventional ones of this for 
 mula; they are sufficiently well known from the litera 
 ture and in practice to require no further discussion. An outstanding member is, for example, triethylaluminum. (3) The silane component (3) which completes the catalyst system is, in particular, a trialkoxy(alkyl)aryl 
 or dialkoxydi(alkyl)arylsilane of the stated formula. Outstanding members are triethoxytolyl-, triethoxy(e- thylphenyl)-, dimethoxyditolyl- and dimethoxydi(ethyl phenyl)silane; other examples are trimethoxytolyl-, trimethoxy(ethylpheny)- and trimethoxyphenylsilane, triethoxyphenylsilane, dimethoxydiphenylsilane, and diethoxyditolyl-, diethoxydi(ethylphenyl)- and diethox ydiphenylsilane. 
 The novel process permits homo- and copolymers, for example of the binary or ternary type, including 
 block copolymers, of propene with minor amounts of 
 other C2-C12-a-monoolefins to be prepared in an ad vantageous manner, particularly suitable a-monoolefins as comonomers be polymerized being ethene, but-1-ene, 4-methylpent-1-ene and hex-1-ene; other suitable exam 
 ples are n-oct-1-ene, n-dec-1-ene. and n-dodec-1-ene.

 by weight of the carrier (III), after which the phthaloyl dichloride (V) is introduced, 27 molar parts of the phthaloyl dichloride (V) being used per 100 molar parts of the magnesium chloride (I), the combined substances are kept at 100° C. for 0.25 hour while stirring, and the resulting solid-phase intermediate is isolated by filtra tion under suction with removal of the liquid phase, 
 then 
 (1.2) in a second stage, the solid-phase intermediate obtained in the first stage is subjected to a two-phase 
 extraction with titanium tetrachloride at 125° C. for 0.5 hour in each stage, in each case 70 parts by weight, i.e. a total of 140 parts by weight, of the titanium tetrachlo ride being used per 10 parts by weight of the solid-phase 
 intermediate obtained from the first stage, after which the resulting solid-phase intermediate is isolated by means of filtration, and finally (1.3) in a third stage, the solid-phase intermediate obtained in the second stage is extracted with n-heptane until the solid contains 3.8% by weight of free titanium tetrachloride, and the titanium component (1) is ob tained in this manner.

 PROCESS FOR OBTAINING THE SAME 
 This application is a Continuation-In-Part of application 
 Ser. No. 10/518,443 filed Jul. 1, 2005, now abandoned which 
 is the National phase of PCT International Application No. 
 PCT/BR2002/000086 filed on Jun. 19, 2002, all of which are hereby expressly incorporated by reference into the present application. 
 The present invention relates to a solid catalyst component 
 for ethylene polymerization and copolymerization, com 
 posed of a carrier of particulate silica and a catalytically active 
 portion including titanium, magnesium, chlorine, alkoxy 
 groups and at least one organometallic compound of the 
 groups 1, 2, 12 or 13 of the periodic table. The process for 
 producing the catalyst of the present invention comprises the 
 steps of: 
 (a) impregnating an activated silica particles with a solution 
 ofan organometallic compound of the groups 1, 2, 12 or 13 
 of the periodic table, in an inert organic solvent; (b) removing the Supernatant liquid from the step (a): 
 (c) preparing a solution obtained by reacting at least one magnesium compound, selected from magnesium halides 
 and magnesium alkoxides and at least one titanium com 
 pound selected from titanium alkoxides and titanium halo gen alkoxides; 
 (d) impregnating the silica obtained in (b) using the Solution prepared in (c); 
 (e) optionally reacting the solid obtained in (d) with a reduc ing agent; 
 (f) reacting the solid obtained in (d) or (e) with a halogenating 
 agent, 
 (g) thermally treating the Solid obtained in (f); 
 (h) washing the Solid obtained in (g) with an inert organic 
 solvent; 
 (i) optionally, washing the Solid obtained in (h) with a solu tion of one or more organometallic compounds of the 
 groups 1, 2, 12 or 13 of the periodic table. The catalyst component obtained is especially suitable for the production of homo- and copolymers of ethylene as nar 
 row molecular weight distribution high density polyethylene 
 and linear low density polyethylene with controlled morphol 
 ogy and improved structure. 
 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 
 1) Polymerization Process 
 The slurry or gas phase processes for the production of 
 HDPE or LLDPE operating with low bulk density polymers 
 require reactors with large Volumes in order to obtain the necessary residence time. Particularly, in the gas phase reac 
 tors, the presence offines with low bulk density causes prob 
 lems. In fact, due to the friction of the polymer particles present in the reactor, the fines are especially prone to the 
 formation of electrostatic charges and tend to deposit and adhere to the metallic walls. These stagnant deposits do not 
 allow the exchange of the reaction heat and become hot spots, which can form layers of agglomerates containing eventually 
 melt polymer. After a period of time chunks of agglomerates can fall down and plug the product discharge system. The 
 described effects are enhanced when the reaction is carried 
 out with a highly active catalyst. 
 In U.S. Pat. No. 5,410.002 a summary of patents on the above described phenomena is presented. 10

 Therefore, it is crucial for the process that the catalyst used 
 enables a total control of the polymer morphology resulting in 
 product grains without fines, with high bulk density and good flowing properties. 
 Another very important aspect is that the catalyst must 
 have a slow decaying time to permit the use of reactors in 
 series. This arrangement makes possible the obtainment of 
 bimodal products in addition to the reduction of the total 
 volume of the reaction for the same production basis. More 
 over, process operations with a different condition of reaction 
 in at least two reactors in series, makes possible the use of catalysts with higher particle size thereby minimizing the 
 formation of electrostatic charges. 
 2) Polymer Structure 
 The catalyst properties are fundamental to the polymer 
 structure, mainly with respect to the molecular weight distri 
 bution, comonomer insertion in the polymeric chain and 
 soluble content. 
 Each application used to achieve a final product from high 
 density polyethylene (HDPE) or linear low density polyeth 
 ylene (LLDPE) requires a specific polymeric structure. 
 To obtain a film with improved optical and mechanical properties and avoid blocking problems, a polymer having a 
 narrow molecular weight distribution (MFR<27), is required. A large quantity of LLDPE applications requires products 
 with a density=0.918 and a MI=0.7, and in most cases a 
 xylene soluble content<10% is desired. Indeed, when the Xylene soluble content of the polymer is present in a high 
 concentration (>10%) and with a low molecular weight, this soluble content tends to migrate to the film Surface causing blocking, in addition to the unsatisfactory optical properties 
 (low gloss and high haze). 3) Ziegler-Natta Polyethylene Catalyst 
 Due to the strong competition existent in the polyethylene 
 market, the catalyst production cost is a fundamental compo 
 nent. Therefore it is mandatory that the catalyst for producing 
 polyethylene be manufactured by a simple route, from low 
 cost raw material, without generating gaseous, liquid or Solid 
 effluents which are hard to treat. 
 U.S. Pat. No. 5,188,997 describes a synthesis process for Ziegler-Natta catalysts from silica and magnesium chloride 
 alcoholate. The results reported demonstrate that this catalyst produces a polymer with low bulk density (0.23 to 0.30 g/ml) 
 and with an intermediate molecular weight distribution (MFR 
 30.0 to 37.8). U.S. Pat. No. 5,585,317 describes the synthesis of a cata lyst Supported on a magnesium chloride based carrier. The reported examples relates to the production of polymers hav 
 ing good morphology, characterized by the absence of fines 
 and by the high bulk density which is, for LLDPE, produced 
 between 0.32 and 0.40 g/ml and for HDPE, between 0.33 and 0.438 g/ml. 
 However, in the case of LLDPE production, the polymer 
 obtained presents an undesired comonomer distribution in its 
 chain, evidenced by the high xylene soluble content at differ ent polymer densities. As an example, a polyethylene with 
 0.919 g/ml of polymer density has a xylene soluble content of 12.5% by weight.

 Accordingly, the present invention concerns a process for the preparation of a Solid catalyst component for the poly 
 merization of ethylene and the copolymerization of ethylene

 rine, alkoxy groups and at least one organometallic com 
 pound of the groups 1, 2, 12 or 13 of the periodic table. According to FIG. 1, this process comprises the following 
 steps: 
 (a) impregnating an activated silica particles with a solu tion of an organometallic compound of the groups 1, 2, 
 12 or 13 of the periodic table, in an inert organic solvent; (b) removing the Supernatant liquid from the step (a): 
 (c) preparing a solution obtained by reacting at least one magnesium compound, selected from magnesium 
 halides and magnesium alkoxides and at least one tita 
 nium compound selected from titanium alkoxides and

 solvent; (i) optionally, washing the solid obtained in (h) with a Solution of one or more organometallic compounds of 
 the groups 1, 2, 12 or 13 of the periodic table. In step (a) of the process according to the present invention, the preferable silica for this purpose is a microspheroidal, 
 porous silica having an average particle size ranging from 10 
 to 120 um, preferably between 15 and 100 um, a SiO con tents of >90% by weight, a surface area ranging from 250 to 500 m/g, preferably between 300 and 400 m/g, a pore

 over a period from 1 to 20 hours. The amount of remaining 
 OH on the silica surface after this treatment ranges from 0.1 to 2 mmoles OH per g of silica, preferably between 0.5 and 
 1.5 mmoles OH per g of silica. The impregnation is preferably carried out by Suspending

 2, 12 or 13, in aliphatic hydrocarbons, and maintaining the 
 Solution with stirring at a temperature which ranges from 
 room temperature to the boiling point of the solution of the organometallic compound of the groups 1, 2, 12 or 13, in aliphatic hydrocarbons, preferably at room temperature, over 
 a period from 30 to 120 minutes, preferably between 50 and

 mmole of the organometallic solution per mmole of OH on 
 the silica surface, preferably 0.3 to 0.7 mmoles of the orga 
 nometallic solution per mmole of OH on the silica surface. At the end of the impregnation treatment, the silica can be removed (step b) from the Suspension by usual methods such as settling and siphoning, filtration or centrifugation. The 
 operating temperature of this step can vary from room tem perature to the boiling point of the aliphatic hydrocarbonused 
 as the solvent, preferably at room temperature. The wet silica 
 is directly used in the next step. 
 According to the present invention, in step (c) of the pro 
 cess, a liquid component from the reaction between at least one magnesium compound, chosen from magnesium halides 
 and magnesium alkoxides and at least one titanium com 
 pound, chosen from titanium alkoxides and titanium halogen alkoxides, is prepared. Generally, it is necessary to heat the

 temperature of the obtained liquid product can be reduced to ambient temperature without precipitation of any solid. This 
 liquid component is diluted in an inert organic solvent to form 10

 The amount of titanium compound used in the above preparation corresponds to an amount ranging from 0.01 to 1 
 g of titanium per g of silica, preferably between 0.0175 and 
 0.175 g of titanium per g of silica. In general, when preparing the solution of the step (c), 
 titanium is used in Such an amount that the molar ratio Ti/Mg varies within the range of 0.3 to 4, and preferably within the range of 0.5 to 2. 
 In step (d) the silica obtained in step (b) is suspended in an inert organic solvent, such as a hydrocarbon Solvent of the aliphatic type, preferably the same used in the previous steps 
 and the dissolved product prepared in step (c) is added to the Suspension. The impregnation is carried out by Suspending 
 100 parts by weight of silica, obtained on step (b), for each 5 to 200 parts by volume of the component prepared on step (c) 
 and after dilution in the inert organic solvent. The Suspension is maintained under stirring at a temperature that ranges from 
 room temperature to the boiling point of the mixture, prefer 
 ably at 60°C., over a period of time from 30 to 180 minutes, preferably between 50 and 60 minutes. In this way a solid component Suspended in an inert organic solvent is obtained. 
 Optionally the solid component obtained in step (d) can be 
 Submitted to reducing conditions in a step (e). Said result is obtained, for example, by using reducing agents, such as Na-alkyls, Li-alkyls, Zn-alkyls, Mg-alkyls and correspond

 wherein R represents a linear or branched alkyl group, con taining from 1 to 10 carbons or aryl-derivatives and X repre sents a halogenatom and preferably a chlorine atom, Al-alkyl

 practice of this invention are: silanes (SiH, in which m is a number equal to or higher than 1), alkyl-silanes or aryl 
 silanes (RSiH, in which Risalkyl oraryland X is a number varying from 1 to 3) and alkoxy-silanes or aryloxy-silanes 
 (RO, SiH, in which R is alkyl or aryl and x is a number 
 varying from 1 to 3). 
 The reducing agent chosen from the above examples, pref 
 erably polymethylhydrosiloxanes (PMHS), is added to the 
 solid obtained in the step (d), dissolved preferably in the same 
 inert organic solvent used for the reaction Suspension. This 
 addition is carried out slowly over a period of time from 30 to 
 180 minutes, preferably between 50 and 80 minutes and the Solid Suspension is maintained under stirring at a temperature 
 ranging from room temperature to the boiling point of the 
 aliphatic hydrocarbon used as solvent, preferably at 60° C. 
 The amount of reducing agent that can be used in step (e) 
 corresponds to the amount ranging from 0 to 2 moles per mole 
 of titanium, preferably between 0 and 0.1 mole per mole of 
 titanium. It has been observed, in the experiments, that the 
 quantity used of this reducing agent can control the amount of 
 titanium fixed on silica at the final catalyst. In the next step of the process according to the present 
 invention, the Suspension obtained in (d) or (e), which is still under stirring, is put in contact and interacted with one or more halogenating agents. 
 Halogenating agents useful in the practice of the present 
 invention can be either liquid or gaseous materials, pure or preferably dissolved in an inert organic solvent. Representa

 and of these SiCl, SnCl4, HCl, Cl, HSiCl, methyl trichlo rosilane, dimethyl dichlorosilane, t-butyl chloride, n-butyl 
 chloride, chloroform, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, 1,1,2-trichloro

 titanium. 
 The time necessary for halogenating Ti-alkoxide and optionally Mg-alkoxide varies from 0.5 hour to 5 hours, pref 
 erably from 1.5 hours to 2.5 hours. The temperature of the Solid Suspension halogenation ranges from room temperature 
 to the boiling point of the aliphatic hydrocarbon used as 
 solvent, preferably at 60° C. According to the present invention, in step (g) of the pro 
 cess, the Solid obtained in (f) is kept under higher temperature 
 that depends on the inert organic solvent used. 
 The time necessary for this thermal treatment of the solid obtained in step (f) ranges from 0.5 hour to 5 hours, preferably from 3 to 5 hours. The ideal temperature for this purpose 
 depends on the organic solvent used and it can be conducted 5

 from 60° C. to 120° C., preferably from 60°C. to 75°C., when hexane is used as the organic solvent. 
 At the step (h) after the thermal treatment, the solid can be separated from the Suspension, for example by settling and 
 siphoning, filtration or centrifugation, washed with an inert 
 organic solvent, preferably hexane, and then dried. The wash ing temperature can vary from room temperature to the boil 
 ing point of the aliphatic hydrocarbon used as solvent, pref erably at room temperature. 
 Optionally, the solid obtained in (h) is washed with a solu tion of organometallic compounds of the groups 1, 2, 12 or 13. 
 More specifically, in the optional step (i) the solid obtained in 
 step (h) is suspended in an inert organic solvent such as 
 hexane or heptane, and it is put in contact with one or more organometallic compounds of the groups 1, 2, 12 or 13 of the periodic table, preferably metal-alkyl compounds or metal 
 alkylhalide compounds belonging to these groups, in special 
 aluminum, magnesium, lithium and Zinc compounds. Spe cific examples of these compounds are methylaluminum 
 dichloride, methylaluminum sesquichloride, isobutylalumi 
 num dichloride, isobutylaluminum sesquichloride, ethylalu 
 minum dichloride (EADC), diethylaluminum chloride (DEAC), ethylaluminum sesquichloride (EASC), tri-n-hexy 
 laluminum (Tn-HAL), tri-n-octylaluminum (TnOAL). They

 of the organic solvent used as solvent, preferably at room temperature, for a period of time that can vary from 10 min 
 utes to 24 hours, preferably from 40 minutes to 5 hours. When using more than one organometallic compound in 
 the step (i), the different compounds can be fed in the same 
 Solution or in individual Solutions, at the same time or in Subsequent additions. 
 The amount of the metal-alkyl halide compound of the groups 1, 2, 12 or 13 or metal-alkyl compound of the groups 
 1, 2, 12 or 13, used in the step (i) of the process corresponds 
 to the amount ranging from 0 to 3 g of the corresponding metal-alkyl halide compound of the groups 1, 2, 12 or 13 or 
 metal-alkyl compound of the groups 1, 2, 12 or 13, per g of 
 dry catalyst component obtained, preferably between 0.05 and 1 g of the corresponding metal-alkylhalide compound of 
 the groups 1, 2, 12 or 13 or metal-alkyl compound of the groups 1, 2, 12 or 13, per g of dry catalyst component 
 obtained. 
 The use of inert organic solvents, most specifically ali phatic hydrocarbons, in all process steps of the present inven 
 tion brings another important feature to the Solid catalyst 
 component characteristics. The Solid catalyst component 
 obtained is completely free of residual polar solvents, such as 
 ethanol, and their derivatives in its final composition. 
 The titanium amount that remains fixed on the Solid cata 
 lyst component may reach up to 10% by weight, expressed as 
 the Timetal content, and it is preferably comprised between 0.5 and 2% by weight. 
 The magnesium amount that remains fixed on the Solid catalyst component may reach up to 6% by weight, expressed 
 as the Mg metal content, and it is preferably comprised 
 between 0.3 and 3.0% by weight. 
 The chlorine amount that remains fixed on the solid cata 
 lyst component may reach up to 20% by weight, expressed as 
 the C1 contents, and it is preferably between 5 and 12% by weight. 
 The alkoxy amount that remains fixed on the Solid catalyst component may reach up to 20% by weight and it is prefer 
 ably between 3 and 8% by weight. US 9,352,308 B2 
 The amount of organometallic compound of the groups 1, 
 2, 12 or 13 that remains fixed on the solid catalyst component may reach up to 5% by weight, expressed as the metal con 
 tents, and it is preferably between 0.3 and 3% by weight. This organometallic compound of the groups 1, 2, 12 or 13 are metal-alkyl compounds or metal-alkyl halide compounds belonging to these groups, in special organoaluminum, orga 
 nomagnesium, organolithium and organozinc compounds, 
 pure or in mixtures. The particle size distribution of the solid catalyst compo 
 nent of the present invention is very close to the silica used as carrier and, as consequence, its average particle size ranges 
 also from 10 to 120 um. The solid catalyst component surface area ranges from 80 to 300 m/g and its pore volume ranges 
 from 0.1 to 1.0 ml/g. The catalyst component of the present invention is Suitable for using in liquid phase or gas phase, ethylene polymeriza 
 tion process. The co-catalyst used in the polymerization pro 
 cess is an alkyl-aluminum, preferably trimethyl aluminum or 
 triethyl aluminum. The mass ratio co-catalyst:catalyst in the polymerization process is between 0.5:1 and 6.0:1. 
 An important feature is its ability to produce, when sub 
 mitted to polymerization conditions, particles of homo and copolymers of ethylene with controlled morphology having 
 high bulk density and containing a very Small quantity of 
 fines. This feature allows the use of this catalyst in a process where the catalyst can be fed directly into the polymerization 
 reactor. Particular forms to feed the catalyst are in dry bulk powder, in paste, in oil Suspension or in solvent Suspension. 
 As an alternative the catalyst can be prepolymerized with 
 ethylene or propylene and optionally with a comonomer 
 before being fed into the reactor. Another important feature of the present invention is its tolerance to the high electrostatic charges occurring in gas 
 phase reactors. This feature helps to prevent the formation of 
 polymer sheets or agglomerates on the reactor walls. The 
 good catalytic yield and the low decay kinetics observed for 
 the present invention, allows its use in most polymerization processes, including processes operating in more than one 
 reactor in series. 
 A further feature characteristic of the catalyst of the present invention is when using a microspheroidal silica as Support 
 the catalyst obtained has also a spheroidal morphology and in consequence a polymer product with good morphology and 
 flowability is obtained. 
 The catalyst component of the present invention is advan tageously used in the polymerization of ethylene and mix 
 tures thereof with alpha-olefins CH2=CHR, wherein R is an alkyl or cicloalkyl or aryl radical with 1-12 carbon atoms 
 because it has a high activity and low decay kinetics. In particular, it is used in the preparation of: High density polyethylenes (HDPE, having a density greater than 0.940 g/cm), particularly with narrow 
 molecular weight distribution (MFR-27), including homopolymers of ethylene and copolymers of ethylene 
 with one or more alpha-olefins having from 3 to 14 
 carbon atoms. These products are particularly Suitable for thermoforming and injection applications; 
 Linear medium density and linear low density polyethyl 
 enes (LMDPE and LLDPE, having a density lower than 0.940 g/cm) most specifically very low and ultra low 
 density linear polyethylenes (VLDPE and ULDPE, hav ing a density lower than 0.920 g/cm and as low as 0.880 g/m) consisting of copolymers of ethylene with one or 
 more alpha-olefins having from 3 to 14 carbon atoms, having a content of units derived from ethylene greater than approximately 80% by weight. These products 10

 have an improved structure due to the very good 
 comonomer insertion and, in most cases, they have also 
 a narrow molecular weight distribution (MFR-27). 
 Hence the low xylene soluble contents are obtained, allowing the production of films with superior optical 
 properties and very low blocking. The LMDPE products are particularly useful for rotomolding applications; 
 Elastomeric copolymers of ethylene and propylene and 
 elastomeric terpolymers of ethylene and propylene with 
 minor amounts of a diene, having a content of units derived from ethylene comprised between about 30 and 70% by weight.

 anhydrous MgCl, and 330 ml (0.969 moles) of Ti(OBu). 
 This mixture was allowed to stir at 300 rpm and heated to 150° 
 C. for about 12 hours in order to have the solids completely dissolved, thereby a clear liquid product was obtained. This resulting liquid was cooled down to 40°C. and under gently 
 stirring at 150 rpm, it was diluted with 3200 ml of anhydrous 
 hexane. Into this solution kept at 40° C. and under the same stirring, 250g of the silica support were added. This silica was 
 previously dehydrated and treated with 19 ml (0.139 moles) of triethylaluminum diluted in anhydrous hexane, for 50 min 
 utes and at room temperature. Once the addition of the silica is completed, the mixture was heated to 60° C. and kept at this 
 temperature for 1 hour. Into this mixture, kept at 60° C. and undergently stirring, a solution consisting of 100 ml of anhy 
 drous hexane and 192 ml of PMHS (0.085 moles) was dropped into it over a period of time of 1.5 hours. At the end 
 of the addition, stirring was continued for 2 hours at a tem 
 perature of 60° C. To this mixture a solution of 200 ml of anhydrous hexane and 184 ml of SiC1 (1.606 moles) was dropped over a period of time of 1 hour. At the end of the addition, stirring was continued for 3.5 hours at a temperature 
 of 60°C. The temperature of the mixture was then brought to 
 65° C. and kept for additional 2 hours. After cooling the mixture to room temperature, the stirring was stopped to have 
 the solid settled. The supernatant liquid was removed, the Solid was repeatedly washed with anhydrous hexane and then 
 dried at 60° C. under nitrogen flow thus giving 390 g of a reddish powder.

 This mixture was allowed to stir at 300 rpm and heated to 150° C. for about 12 hours in order to have the solids completely dissolved, thereby a clear liquid product was obtained. This 
 resulting liquid was cooled down to 40°C. and under gently stirring at 150 rpm, it was diluted with 3200 ml of anhydrous 
 hexane. Into this solution kept at 40° C. and under the same stirring, 300g of the silica support were added. This silica was previously dehydrated and treated with 23 ml (0.167 moles) 
 of triethylaluminum diluted in anhydrous hexane, for 50 min 
 utes and at room temperature. Once the addition of the silica 
 is completed, the mixture was heated to 60° C. and kept at this temperature for 1 hour. Into this mixture, kept at 60° C. and undergently stirring, a solution consisting of 100 ml of anhy 
 drous hexane and 23 ml of PMHS (0.010 moles) was dropped 
 into it over a period of time of 1.5 hours. At the end of the addition, stirring was continued for 2 hours at a temperature 
 of 60°C. To this mixture a solution of 100 ml of anhydrous 
 hexane and 22 ml of SiCl, (0.192 moles) was dropped over a period of 1 hour. At the end of the addition, stirring was 
 continued for 3.5 hours at a temperature of 60°C. The tem perature of the mixture was then brought to 65° C. and kept

 A 4 liter stainless steel autoclave, purged under nitrogen 
 flow for 1 hour at 75° C. and then cooled to 30° C., was fed with 0.06 g of the solid catalyst component from the example 
 8,0.78g of TEAL mixed with 75 ml of anhydrous hexane, and 280 g of anhydrous propane. The temperature was raised to 
 60° C., and then 520 g of anhydrous propane were fed. The 
 temperature was raised again to 70° C., and then 290 ml of butene-1 were fed simultaneously with 2 bars of hydrogen 
 and 5 bars of ethylene. After that, the temperature is settled to 75° C. The polymerization was conducted in slurry liquid phase. The polymerization time was 3 hours, during which 
 time the ethylene pressure was kept constant. After this period 
 the reaction was stopped by venting off ethylene, butene-1, hydrogen and propane and 240 g of polymer were obtained, 
 which exhibited the following properties: US 9,352,308 B2

 Pilot Plant Tests 
 A pilot plant continuously operated was used to prepare 
 LLDPE as shown in FIG. 2. 
 A fluidized bed gas phase reactor 1 with 45 cm of internal 
 diameter and 120 cm of reaction Zone height is fed by a dry-solid catalyst feeder 2. The bed of polymer particles in 
 reaction Zone3 is kept in fluidized state by a recycle stream 4 
 that works as a fluidizing medium as well as a dissipating heat 
 agent for absorbing the exothermal heat generated within 
 reaction Zone 3. The Superficial velocity of the gas, resulting 
 from the flow rate of recycle stream 4 within reactor 1 is 0.7 10

 m/s. Stream5, which contains the gas discharged from reactor 20 
 1, said gas having low monomer contents, is fed to the Suction 
 of compressor 6. The combined reaction and compression 
 heats are then removed from recycle stream 5 in an external 
 heat exchange system 7 in order to control the reactor tem

 perature. The composition of stream 5 is kept constant to yield a polymer with the required specifications. 
 Make-up components are fed to the system at spot 8 so as 
 to make up the composition of recycle stream 5. So, make-up 
 stream 8 will include the triethyl aluminum (TEAL) that 
 directly reacts in a ratio of 2 moles of TEAL per mole of 
 catalyst. Also at the spot 8, propane is fed as the selected 
 non-reactive compound required to maintain the total pres 
 Sure of the system. 
 The polymerization catalyst is introduced as a dry powder 
 by a catalyst feeder into reactor 1 in a site within the reaction Zone 3, close to the distributing plate 9 in a rate to control the residence time of the catalyst. The reactive gases, including 
 ethylene and comonomers are introduced at the spot 10. 60

 The produced polymer is discharged from the reaction Zone through a discharge system 11 that provides the recovery 
 of the reactive and non-reactive gases, recycling said gases back to the recycle stream 5 at spot 12 and lowers the pressure of the discharged mixture of polymer and gases at certain pressure for later conveying the produced polymer particles 
 13 for downward sampling. 
 Examples 13 to 23 
 The examples 13 to 23 were conducted in the gas phase pilot reactor at 88°C., using in each EXAMPLE respectively the catalysts produced in the EXAMPLES 1 to 10. The cata lyst produced in the EXAMPLE 10 was also used in the pilot polymerization at 75° C. as shown in the EXAMPLE 23. In all examples the pilot reactor run was performed Smoothly, with good catalytic yield and no agglomerates or 
 sheets were formed. The polymers obtained had a good mor 
 phology and, in most cases, less than 1% of fines (<250 um). The films obtained with these polymers presented very good optical properties and a low blocking strength. 
 During the performance of the EXAMPLE 20 it was per 
 formed a decay test and the measured half-life time was 3.8 
 hours. 
 The results are shown in table 1.

 HIGH STRENGTH POLYETHYLENE FILM 
 TECHNICAL FIELD 
 This invention relates to a process for preparing an in Situ polyethylene blend, which can be converted into film having an improved balance of high Strength and exemplary extru 
 Sion characteristics. 
 BACKGROUND INFORMATION 
 There has been a rapid growth in the market for linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), particularly resin made under mild operating conditions, typically at preSSures of 100 to 300 psi and reaction temperatures of less than 100 C. This low pressure proceSS provides a broad range of LLDPE products for blown and cast film, injection molding, rotational molding, blow molding, pipe, tubing, and wire and cable applications. LLDPE has essentially a linear 
 backbone with only short chain branches, about 2 to 6 carbon atoms in length. In LLDPE, the length and frequency of branching, and, consequently, the density, is controlled by 
 the type and amount of comonomer used in the polymer ization. Although the majority of the LLDPE resins on the market today have a narrow molecular weight distribution, LLDPE resins with a broad molecular weight distribution are available for a number of non-film applications. LLDPE resins designed for commodity type applications 
 typically incorporate 1-butene as the comonomer. The use of a higher molecular weight alpha-olefin comonomer pro duces resins with Significant Strength advantages relative to those of ethylene/1-butene copolymers. The predominant 
 higher alpha-olefin comonomers in commercial use are 1-hexene, 4-methyl-1-pentene, and 1-octene. The bulk of the LLDPE is used in film products where the excellent physical properties and drawdown characteristics of LLDPE film makes this film well Suited for a broad Spectrum of appli cations. Fabrication of LLDPE film is generally effected by the blown film and Slot casting processes. The resulting film is characterized by excellent tensile Strength, high ultimate elongation, good impact Strength, and excellent puncture 
 resistance. 
 These properties together with toughneSS are enhanced when the polyethylene is of high molecular weight. However, as the molecular weight of the polyethylene increases, the processability of the resin usually decreases. By providing a blend of polymers, the properties character 
 istic of high molecular weight resins can be retained and processability, particularly the extrudability (from the lower molecular weight component) can be improved. 
 The blending of these polymerS is Successfully achieved 
 in a Staged reactor proceSS Similar to those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,047,468 and 5,149,738. Briefly, the process is one for the in Situ blending of polymers wherein a higher density ethylene copolymer is prepared in a high melt indeX reactor and a lower density ethylene copolymer is prepared 
 in a low melt indeX reactor. The process typically comprises continuously contacting, under polymerization conditions, a 
 mixture of ethylene and one or more alpha-olefins with a catalyst System in two gas phase, fluidized bed reactors connected in Series, said catalyst System comprising: (i) a Supported magnesium/titanium based catalyst precursor; (ii) an aluminum containing activator compound; and (iii) a hydrocarbyl aluminum cocatalyst, the polymerization con ditions being Such that an ethylene copolymer having a melt 
 index in the range of about 0.1 to about 1000 grams per 10 
 minutes is formed in the high melt indeX reactor and an ethylene copolymer having a melt indeX in the range of 
 about 0.001 to about 1 gram per 10 minutes is formed in the low melt indeX reactor, each copolymer having a density of 
 about 0.860 to about 0.965 gram per cubic centimeter and a melt flow ratio in the range of about 22 to about 70, with the provisoS that: 1O

 (a) the mixture of ethylene copolymer matrix and active 
 catalyst formed in the first reactor in the Series is 
 transferred to the Second reactor in the Series, 
 (b) other than the active catalyst referred to in proviso (a) and the cocatalyst referred to in proviso (e), no addi 
 tional catalyst is introduced into the Second reactor; 
 (c) in the high melt index reactor: (1) the alpha-olefin is present in a ratio of about 0.02 to about 3.5 moles of alpha-olefin per mole of ethylene; 
 and 
 (2) hydrogen is present in a ratio of about 0.05 to about 3 moles of hydrogen per mole of combined ethylene and alpha-olefin; 
 (d) in the low melt index reactor: (1) the alpha-olefin is present in a ratio of about 0.02 to about 3.5 moles of alpha-olefin per mole of ethylene; 
 and 
 (2) hydrogen is, optionally, present in a ratio of about 
 0.0001 to about 0.5 mole of hydrogen per mole of combined ethylene and alpha-olefin; and 
 (e) additional hydrocarbyl aluminum cocatalyst is intro 
 duced into the Second reactor in an amount Sufficient to 
 restore the level of activity of the catalyst transferred 
 from the first reactor to about the initial level of activity 
 in the first reactor. 
 While the in situ blends prepared as above and the films produced therefrom are found to have the advantageous 
 characteristics heretofore mentioned, the commercial appli cation of these granular bimodal polymerS is limited by unacceptable levels of gels in contrast to competitive bimo dal resins produced from Slurry or Solution processes. Par 
 ticle size distribution and flow characteristics Studies indi 
 cate that the gas phase resins having an average particle size (APS) of about 400 to about 600 microns exhibit significant compositional, molecular, and rheological heterogeneities. When Such a granular resin is compounded, for example, 
 with a conventional twin Screw mixer in a single pass, and the resulting pellets are fabricated into film, the film exhibits a high level of gels ranging in size from less than about 100 microns to greater than about 500 microns. These gels adversely effect the aesthetic appearance of the product. The gel characteristics of a film product are usually designated by a subjective scale of Film Appearance Rating (FAR) varying from minus 50 (very poor; these films have a large number of large gels) to plus 50 (very good; these films have a Small amount of, or essentially no, gels). The FAR of the Single pass film product mentioned above is generally in the 
 range of about minus 50 to about minus 10/0. For commer cial acceptability, the FAR should be plus 20 or better. Several patents have Successfully addressed the gel prob 
 lem. One such patent is U.S. Pat. No. 5,405,901. Unfortunately, this patent, for example, Suffers from other 
 deficiencies. The extrusion line Speed of the product resin, which is a measure of bubble strength and stability, is found to be in the neighborhood of 90 feet per minute, and the dart drop Strength, while high for one mil film, is not achievable 
 on 0.5 mil film due to low bubble stability. Meanwhile, in the realm of high and medium density, high molecular weight film applications, industry is Seeking resins with minimum 
 extrusion line Speeds of about 210 feet per minute and thus films with higher bubble strength and stability together with higher dart drop Strength in the narrower gauges. 
 DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION 
 An object of this invention, therefore, is to provide a process for preparing an in Situ blend, which, can be extruded into a film at high line Speeds, the film having the bubble strength and stability, which translates into high US 6,248,831 B1

 Strength, particularly in terms of dart drop. Other objects and 
 advantages will become apparent hereinafter. 
 According to the present invention Such a proceSS for the 
 production of a polyethylene blend in Situ has been discov 
 ered. The proceSS comprises contacting ethylene and at least 
 one alpha-olefin comonomer having 3 to 8 carbon atoms with a magnesium/titanium based catalyst System including 
 a partially activated precursor and a cocatalyst in each of two 
 fluidized bed reactors connected in Series, in the gas phase, under polymerization conditions, with the provisoS that: 
 (a) the precursor is formed by contacting an alkylalumi 
 num halide with a Solid reaction product prepared from 
 a magnesium alkoxide, a titanium tetraalkoxide, and a Solubility enhancing agent; 
 (b) the mixture of ethylene copolymer matrix and active 
 catalyst formed in the first reactor in the Series is 
 transferred to the Second reactor in the Series, 
 (c) other than the active catalyst referred to in proviso (b)

 tional catalyst is introduced into the Second reactor;

 mer is made: 
 (1) alpha-olefin is present in a ratio of about 0.005 to 
 about 0.4 mole of alpha-olefin per mole of ethylene; 
 (2) hydrogen is, optionally, present in a ratio of about 
 0.0001 to about 0.3 mole of hydrogen per mole of 
 ethylene, and 
 (3) the ethylene partial pressure is in the range of about 
 10 to about 100 pounds per Square inch; and 
 (e) in the Second reactor in which a high melt index copolymer is made: 
 (1) alpha-olefinis, optionally, present in a ratio of about 
 0.005 to about 0.6 mole of alpha-olefin per mole of ethylene, 
 (2) hydrogen is, optionally, present in a ratio of about 
 1.0 to about 3.0 moles of hydrogen per mole of ethylene, and 
 (3) the ethylene partial pressure is in the range of about 
 50 to about 120 pounds per Square inch, and 
 (f) additional hydrocarbyl aluminum cocatalyst is intro 
 duced into the Second reactor in an amount Sufficient to 
 restore the level of activity of the catalyst transferred 
 from the first reactor to about the initial level of activity 
 in the first reactor. 
 DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED 
 EMBODIMENT(S) 
 AS noted, the blend is produced in two staged reactors 
 connected in Series wherein a mixture of resin and activated 
 catalyst precursor is transferred from the first reactor to the 
 Second reactor in which another copolymer is prepared and 
 blends in situ with the copolymer from the first reactor. It 
 will be understood by those skilled in the art that the transfer is effected without exposing the mixture to the atmosphere. 
 The copolymers produced in each of the reactors are copolymers of ethylene and at least one alpha-olefin 
 comonomer having 3 to 8 carbon atoms, preferably one or two alpha-olefin comonomers. The alpha-olefins can be, for example, propylene, 1-butene, 1-hexene, 4-methyl-1- 
 pentene, and 1-octene. 15

 Preferred comonomer combinations: 
 first reactor second reactor 
 1-hexene 1-hexene 
 1-butene 1-hexene 
 1-butene 1-butene 
 1-hexene 1-butene 
 The 1-hexene/1-hexene combination is found to give the best film properties; however, the 1-hexene/1-butene com bination is found to provide acceptable properties while Still meeting FDA Specifications since a terpolymer increases the 
 FDA allowable comonomer content, e.g., for a 1-hexene copolymer, the maximum allowable comonomer content is 10 percent by weight whereas for a 1-hexene/1-butene terpolymer, the maximum allowable comonomer content is 15 percent by weight. For FDA purposes, the 1-hexene/1- 
 hexene combination is considered a copolymer and the 1-hexene/1-butene combination is considered a terpolymer. 
 It will be understood that the in situ blend can be 
 characterized as a bimodal resin. The properties of bimodal resins are Strongly dependent on the proportion of the high 
 molecular weight component, i.e., the low melt indeX com ponent. For a Staged reactor System, the proportion of the high molecular weight component is controlled via the relative production rate in each reactor. The relative produc 
 tion rate in each reactor can, in turn, be controlled by a computer application program, which monitors the produc 
 tion rate in the reactors (measured by heat balance) and then manipulates the ethylene partial preSSure in each reactor and 
 catalyst feed rate in order to meet the production rate, the production rate Split, and catalyst productivity requirements. 
 It will be further understood that there may be a second alpha-olefin comonomer in each reactor coming from a vent recovery System, for example. In this case, recovered liquids 
 containing both comonomers are fed into the first reactor and there is carryover from the first reactor to the Second reactor due to the Solubility of the comonomer in the resin. This could account for a terpolymer in each reactor. The molar ratio of C6 to C4 (or other combination of higher alpha-olefin to lower alpha-olefin) is preferably no less than 
 about 5:1 in the first reactor. Any molar ratio is Satisfactory in the Second reactor. In any case, the overall molar ratioS of alpha-olefin to ethylene in each reactor do not change. 
 High speed extrusion bubble stability is an important 
 factor in blown film extrusion processes. A blown film extrusion proceSS is one in which molten polymer is forced through an annular die to form a continuous cylindrical tube. 
 Outside the die, the tube is blown out to a larger diameter than the die diameter, cooled by an air ring, and then flattened before wind-up. The ratio of the final diameter of the cylindrical tube to the diameter of the annulus is called the blow-up ratio (BUR). The combination of the extrusion rate, BUR, and the speed with which the tube is drawn out determines the final film thickness. The ability to produce thinner films at higher rates of extrusion is governed by many factors including the molecular and Theological char acteristics of the molten polymer, dependence of properties on temperature, and the design of the air ring. 
 The entire cylindrical tube between the die and the collapsing frame (where the tube is flattened) is called the “bubble.” This is a cylindrical bubble in contrast to tradi tionally familiar spherical bubbles in which air, or some other gas, is enveloped by a thin liquid film. Here, air is used 
 to blow a thin molten polymer film. The bubble looks conical from the outside because of a change in the diameter until the solidification at the frost-line height (FLH). US 6,248,831 B1 
 S 
 Sometimes, e.g., with high density polyethylene, the bubble 
 looks like a cylindrical Semi-molten tube with a diameter approximately equal to the ring diameter before being blown 
 out into a larger diameter. Past the FLH, however, the shape does not change from a circular cylindrical tube of constant 
 diameter. Note that between the die and the FLH the bubble 
 is always Semi-molten. 
 One would like to produce a final film with close tolerance in film thickneSS under Stable conditions of operation. That is, the shape of the bubble remains the same without any change over time. The highest extrusion rate and the highest wind-up speed that can be used without changing the shape of the bubble provides the operating constraints for a given resin in a given System (extruder, air ring, cooling air temperature, etc.). For example, at a given extrusion rate, if one can increase the wind-up speed to make thinner film without losing the shape of the bubble, then the resin is said to have good high Speed extrusion bubble Stability. 
 Often, the bubble stability within a given extrusion sys 
 tem is directly related to the molecular characteristics which influence the behavior of the bubble. For example, it is easier to Stretch chewing gum into a very thin thread without breakage than a rubber band. A rubber band stiffens as it is Stretched and, beyond a certain point, it will break. However, the stiffening of the rubber band also gives it better stability 
 since it will be less sensitive to external disturbances. This 
 is not the case with the chewing gum Since it deforms very 
 easily and is very sensitive to disturbances. In the blown film concept, one would like to have rubber band behavior as the bubble is being blown and stretched rather than a chewing gum behavior. In this invention, the combination of a particular precursor, in Situ blending, ethylene partial 
 preSSure, and other defined parameters has been found to provide better high speed extrusion bubble stability, i.e., the film can be drawn at higher wind-up speeds to produce 
 thinner films. 
 The magnesium/titanium based catalyst System can be 
 exemplified by the catalyst system described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,122,494. This System includes a precursor, an activator, and a cocatalyst. The precursor can be Supported or unsup ported. The precursor (prior to activation) is formed by contacting a magnesium alkoxide, a titanium tetraalkoxide, and Small amount of a Solubility enhancing agent which can be a species Such as carbon dioxide, triethylborate, a bromide, or a phenolic compound Selected from the group consisting of phenol and a phenol Substituted with an alkyl, an alkoxy, a halogen, or a dialkylamino group and can be 
 isolated as a solid either by removal of solvent (as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,106,806) or by precipitation as a halide complex (as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,066,737). The reaction product can be represented essentially by the for mula MgTiOOR):X wherein each R is independently an alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, preferably ethyl, and 
 each X is independently a halide anion or a monovalent anion of a phenolic compound. X is preferably chloride or an anion of ortho-cresol or 2,6-di-t-butyl-4-methylphenol. The precursor is partially activated by contacting with an alkylaluminum halide. The alkylaluminum halide is an acti Vator compound and can be represented by the formula 
 RATY, wherein R is an alkyl group having 1 to 8 carbon atoms, Y is a halogen Such as chlorine, bromine, or iodine, preferably chlorine; and n is 1 or 2. More detail can be found in U.S. Patent application Ser. No. 09/395,924 filed on Sep. 14, 1999, particularly examples 5 and 7. 
 Preferred activators include alkylaluminum mono- and 
 dichlorides wherein each alkyl radical has 1 to 6 carbon atoms. Examples of preferred activators are diethylalumi num chloride (DEAC) and ethylaluminum dichloride (EADC). Other conventional activators can also be used if desired. The molar ratio of activator to titanium can be in the 15

 range of about 1:1 to about 150:1 and is preferably in the range of about 10:1 to about 30:1. The cocatalyst, generally a hydrocarbyl aluminum cocatalyst, can be represented by the formula R.Al, (RAIO), or RAIX wherein each R is independently alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, or hydrogen; at least one R is hydrocarbyl, and two or three R radicals can be joined to form a heterocyclic Structure. Each R, which is a hydrocarbyl radical, can have 1 to 20 carbon atoms, and preferably has 1 to 10 carbon atoms. X is a halogen, preferably chlorine, bromine, or iodine. Examples of hydrocarbyl aluminum compounds are as follows: triisobutylaluminum, tri-n-hexylaluminum, di-isobutyl-aluminum hydride, dihexylaluminum dihydride, di-isobutyl-hexylaluminum, isobutyl diheXylaluminum, trimethyl-aluminum, triethylaluminum, tripropylaluminum, 
 trii Sopropylaluminum, tri-n-butyl aluminum, trioctylaluminum, tridecylaluminum, tridodecylaluminum, 
 tribe in Zyl aluminum, trip he nylaluminum, trinaphthylaluminum, tritolylaluminum, dibutylaluminum 
 chloride, diethylaluminum chloride, and ethylaluminum Ses quichloride. The cocatalyst is preferably added Separately 
 neat or as a Solution in an inert Solvent, Such as isopentane, to the polymerization reactor at the Same time as the flow of ethylene is initiated. The cocatalyst compounds can also be 
 used as the activators referred to above. 
 As noted in U.S. Pat. No. 5,122,494, selectivity control agents can be used in the polymerization proceSS if desired, preferably when the primary olefin is propylene. 
 AS noted above, the precursor can be prepared as a granular Solid or as a Solution. In those cases where it is desired to Support the Soluble precursor, Silica is the pre ferred Support. Other Suitable Supports are inorganic oxides 
 Such as aluminum phosphate, alumina, Silica/alumina mixtures, Silica modified with an organoaluminum com pound Such as triethylaluminum, and Silica modified with diethyl Zinc. A typical Support is a Solid, particulate, porous 
 material essentially inert to the polymerization. It is used as a dry powder having an average particle size of about 10 to 
 about 250 microns and preferably about 30 to about 100 microns, a Surface area of at least 200 Square meters per gram and preferably at least about 250 Square meters per gram; and a pore Size of at least about 100 angstroms and preferably at least about 200 angstroms. Generally, the 
 amount of support used is that which will provide about 0.1 to about 1.0 millimole of titanium per gram of Support and preferably about 0.4 to about 0.9 millimole of titanium per gram of Support. Impregnation of the above mentioned Soluble catalyst precursor into a Silica Support can be accom plished by mixing the precursor Solution and Silica gel in the 
 electron donor solvent or other solvent followed by solvent removal under reduced preSSure. When a Support is not desired, the Soluble catalyst precursor can be used in liquid 
 form. 
 The entire catalyst System, which includes a partially activated precursor and the cocatalyst, is added to the first reactor. The catalyst is admixed with the copolymer pro 
 duced in the first reactor, and the mixture is transferred to the Second reactor. Insofar as the catalyst is concerned, only cocatalyst is added to the Second reactor from an outside 
 SOCC. 
 The polymerization in each reactor is, preferably, con ducted in the gas phase using a continuous fluidized process. 
 A typical fluidized bed reactor is described in U.S. Pat. No. 
 4,482,687. A relatively low melt index (or high molecular weight) copolymer is prepared in the first reactor. The first reactor is generally Smaller in size than the Second reactor because only a portion of the final product is made in the first reactor. The mixture of polymer and an active catalyst is usually 
 transferred from the first reactor to the Second reactor via an US 6,248,831 B1 
 7 
 interconnecting device using nitrogen or Second reactor recycle gas as a transfer medium. 
 In the high molecular weight (HMW) reactor: 
 Because of the low values, instead of melt index, flow 
 indeX is determined and those values are used in this 
 specification. The flow index (I 21.6) can be in the range of about 0.20 to about 5.0 grams per 10 minutes, and is preferably in the range of about 0.25 to about 4 grams per 10 minutes. The molecular weight of this polymer is, generally, in the range of about 250,000 to about 600,000. The density of the copolymer can be in the range of 0.890 to 0.940 gram per cubic centimeter, and is preferably in the range of 0.900 to 0.935 gram per cubic centimeter. The melt flow ratio (I 21.6/I 2.16) of the polymer can be in the range of about 20 to about 65, and is preferably about 22 to about 
 50. 
 Melt index (I 2.16) is determined under ASTM D-1238, Condition E. It is measured at 190° C. and 2.16 kilograms and reported as grams per 10 minutes. Melt index (I 5) can also be determined under ASTM D-1238, Condition P. It is measured at 190° C. and 5 kilograms and reported as grams per 10 minutes. Flow index (I 21.6) is determined under ASTM D-1238, Condition F. It is measured at 190° C. and 21.6 kilograms and reported as grams per 10 minutes. Melt 
 flow ratio is the ratio of flow index (I 21.6) to melt index (I 2.16 or I 5). 
 In the low molecular weight (LMW) reactor: 
 A relatively high melt index (I 2.16) (or low molecular weight) copolymer is prepared in this reactor. The high melt index can be in the range of about 80 to about 1000 grams per 10 minutes, and is preferably in the range of about 150 to about 900 grams per 10 minutes. The molecular weight of the high melt indeX copolymer is, generally, in the range of about 15,000 to about 35,000. The density of the copolymer prepared in this reactor can be in the range of 0.925 to 0.970 gram per cubic centimeter, and is preferably in the range of 
 0.928 to 0.965 gram per cubic centimeter. The melt flow ratio (I 21.6/I 2.16) of this copolymer can be in the range of about 20 to about 65, and is preferably about 22 to about 50. 
 The blend or final product, as removed from the second reactor, can have a melt index (I5) in the range of about 0.01 to about 2.0 grams per 10 minutes, and preferably has a melt index in the range of about 0.05 to about 1.0 grams per 10 minutes. The melt flow ratio (I 21.6/I 5) is in the range of about 20 to about 45, and is preferably in the range of about 22 to about 42. The average molecular weight of the final product is, generally, in the range of about 200,000 to about 
 350,000. The density of the blend can be in the range of 0.915 to 0.958 gram per cubic centimeter, and is preferably in the range of 0.920 to 0.955 gram per cubic centimeter. 
 The blend has a broad molecular weight distribution 
 which can be characterized as bimodal. The broad molecular 
 weight distribution is reflected in an Mw/Mn ratio of about 18 to about 32, preferably about 20 to about 30. Mw is the weight average molecular weight, Mn is the number average 
 molecular weight; and the Mw/Mn ratio can be referred to as the polydispersity index (PDI), which can be viewed as a measure of the breadth of the molecular weight distribution. 
 The weight ratio of copolymer prepared in the high molecular weight reactor to copolymer prepared in the low 
 molecular weight reactor can be in the range of about 0.8:1 to about 2.3:1, and is preferably in the range of about 0.9:1 to about 1.9:1. The optimum weight ratio is about 1.2:1 to about 1.5:1. This is also known as the split. The magnesium/titanium based catalyst System, ethylene, alpha-olefin, and hydrogen are continuously fed into the first reactor; the polymer/catalyst mixture is continuously trans 
 ferred from the first reactor to the Second reactor; ethylene, alpha-olefin, and hydrogen, as well as cocatalyst are con 15

 tinuously fed to the Second reactor. The final product is continuously removed from the Second reactor. 
 In the low melt index, as reflected in flow index reactor, i.e., the first reactor: The mole ratio of alpha-olefin to ethylene can be in the range of about 0.005:1 to about 0.4:1, and is preferably in the range of about 0.02:1 to about 0.26:1. The mole ratio of hydrogen to ethylene can be in the range 
 of about 0.0001:1 to about 0.3:1, and is preferably in the range of about 0.001:1 to about 0.18:1. The operating temperature is generally in the range of about 60° C. to about 100° C. Preferred operating temperatures vary depending on 
 the density desired, i.e., lower temperatures for lower den Sities and higher temperatures for higher densities. 
 In the high melt indeX reactor, i.e., the Second reactor: The mole ratio of alpha-olefin (optional) to ethylene can 
 be in the range of about 0.005:1 to about 0.6:1, and is preferably in the range of about 0.01:1 to about 0.42:1. The mole ratio of hydrogen to ethylene can be in the range of 
 about 1.0:1 to about 3:1, and is preferably in the range of about 1.3:1 to about 2.2:1. The operating temperature is generally in the range of about 70° C. to about 110° C. As mentioned above, the temperature is preferably varied with the desired density. 
 The total reactor pressure in the Second reactor is usually higher than that used in the first reactor because of higher ethylene partial pressures and high hydrogen/ethylene 
 requirements. The pressure, i.e., the total pressure in each 
 reactor, can be in the range of about 200 to about 450 psig and is preferably in the range of about 280 to about 400 psig. The ethylene partial pressure in the first reactor can be in the range of about 10 to about 100 psi and is preferably in the range of about 20 to about 60 psi. The ethylene partial 
 preSSure in the Second reactor can be in the range of about 50 to about 120 psi and is preferably in the range of about 60 to about 110 psi. The upper limit of ethylene partial preSSure in the first reactor and the ethylene partial preSSure 
 in the Second reactor are Set according to the amount of copolymer it is desired to produce in each of these reactors, 
 i.e., to achieve the Split mentioned above. It is noted that increasing the ethylene partial pressure in the first reactor 
 leads to an increase in ethylene partial pressure in the Second reactor. Generally, the ethylene partial preSSure roughly 
 doubles in the second reactor over the first reactor. The 
 balance of the total preSSure is provided by alpha-olefin 
 other than ethylene and an inert gas Such as nitrogen. 
 A typical fluidized bed reactor can be described as fol 
 lows: 
 The bed is usually made up of the same granular resin that is to be produced in the reactor. Thus, during the course of the polymerization, the bed comprises formed polymer particles, growing polymer particles, and catalyst particles 
 fluidized by polymerization and modifying gaseous compo 
 nents introduced at a flow rate or Velocity Sufficient to cause the particles to Separate and act as a fluid. The fluidizing gas is made up of the initial feed, make-up feed, and cycle (recycle) gas, i.e., comonomers and, if desired, modifiers and/or an inert carrier gas. 
 The essential parts of the reaction System are the vessels, an interreactor transfer System; a vent recovery System; and, 
 in each vessel: a bed, a gas distribution plate, inlet and outlet piping, a compressor, a cycle gas cooler, and a product 
 discharge System. In each vessel, above the bed, there is a Velocity reduction Zone, and, in the bed, a reaction Zone. Both are above the gas distribution plate. 
 A typical fluidized bed reactor is also described in U.S. 
 Pat. No. 4,482,687. 
 The gaseous feed Streams of ethylene, other gaseous alpha-olefins, and hydrogen, when used, are preferably fed 
 to the reactor recycle line as well as liquid alpha-olefins and US 6,248,831 B1 
 the cocatalyst Solution. Optionally, the liquid cocatalyst can be fed directly to the fluidized bed. The partially activated catalyst precursor is preferably injected into the fluidized 
 bed as a Solid or a mineral oil slurry. The cocatalyst completes the activation. The product composition can be 
 varied by changing the molar ratioS of the comonomers introduced into the fluidized bed. The product is continu ously discharged in granular or particulate form from the 
 reactor as the bed level builds up with polymerization. The production rate is controlled by adjusting the catalyst feed 
 rate. 
 The hydrogen:ethylene molar ratio can be adjusted to control average molecular weights. The alpha-olefins (other than ethylene) can be present in a total amount of up to 15 percent by weight of the copolymer and, if used, are pref 
 erably included in the copolymer in a total amount of about 1 to about 10 percent by weight based on the weight of the copolymer. 
 Several Steps can be taken, in addition to temperature control, to prevent agglomeration. The product discharge 
 line between the reactor and the product pot is often plugged up with chunks between intervals of product drops. A continuous purge flow of nitrogen or reactor gas in the line prevents the plugging problem. Also, coating the reactor 
 Surface with a low Surface energy material is shown to be beneficial to slow down the rate of fouling build up. In addition, control of the electrostatic level in the bed prevents Static induced particle agglomeration. Static can be adjusted 
 to a Satisfactory level by controlled use of reaction rate, avoidance of quick change of gas composition, Selective use of Static-neutralizing chemicals and Surface passivation with aluminum alkyls. 
 It is preferred to control the Static in the reactor System during Start-up. If the Static is not controlled, Static induced layers of catalyst rich fines can form on the reactor Surfaces. These fines may, in turn, induce localized hot spots and the formation of chunkS. Reactor Surface passivation with an aluminum alkyl minimizes the formation of fines layers. This passivation is accomplished by first building up the 
 aluminum alkyl concentration in the Start-up bed to about 300 to 1000 ppm based on the weight of the bed, and then fluidizing the bed with purified nitrogen or ethylene for 
 Several hours. At the end of this passivation period, the reactor is purged while maintaining the circulation, the 
 reaction conditions are established, and the reaction is kicked off by feeding catalyst into the system. If static still persists, additional purges or Selective use of Static neutral izing chemicals may become necessary to reduce the level of 
 Static. 
 The residence time of the mixture of reactants including gaseous and liquid reactants, catalyst, and resin in each 
 fluidized bed can be in the range of about 1 to about 12 hours and is preferably in the range of about 2 to about 5 hours. 
 The resin blend can be extruded into film in a conven 
 tional extruder adapted for that purpose. Extruders and processes for extrusion are described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,814,135; 4,857,600; 5,076,988; and 5,153,382. Examples of various extruders, which can be used in forming the film are a single Screw type Such as one modified with a blown film die and air ring and continuous take off equipment, a blown film extruder, and a slot cast extruder. A typical Single Screw type extruder can be described as one having a hopper at its upstream end and a die at its downstream end. The hopper feeds into a barrel, which contains a Screw. The barrel can be smooth, but is preferably grooved. At the 
 downstream end, between the end of the Screw and the die, is a Screen pack and a breaker plate. The Screw portion of the 
 extruder is considered to be divided up into three Sections, the feed Section, the compression Section, and the metering Section, and multiple heating Zones from the rear heating 15 
 25 
 35 
 40 
 45 
 50 
 55 
 60 
 65 10 
 Zone to the front heating Zone, the multiple Sections and Zones running from upstream to downstream. If it has more 
 than one barrel, the barrels are connected in Series. The length to diameter ratio of each barrel is in the range of about 16:1 to about 30:1. The extrusion can take place at tempera tures in the range of about 160 to about 270 degrees C. and is preferably carried out attemperatures in the range of about 180 to about 240 degrees C. 
 The advantages of the invention are found in the high extrusion speed of the resin blend; the high bubble strength; and the high bubble stability. Thus, the blend can be extruded to thinner gauges at higher extrusion Speeds, par ticularly gauges of 0.5 mill or leSS. 
 In order to maintain a constant production rate, increases in ethylene partial preSSure are accompanied by decreases in the amount of catalyst fed. Consequently, catalyst produc tivity is increased, an additional advantage of the process. 
 Conventional additives, which can be introduced into the blend, are exemplified by antioxidants, ultraViolet absorbers, antistatic agents, pigments, dyes, nucleating agents, fillers, Slip agents, fire retardants, plasticizers, processing aids, 
 lubricants, Stabilizers, Smoke inhibitors, Viscosity control agents, and crosslinking agents, catalysts, and boosters, 
 tackifiers, and anti-blocking agents. Aside from the fillers, the additives can be present in the blend in amounts of about 0.1 to about 10 parts by weight of additive for each 100 parts by weight of polymer blend. Fillers can be added in amounts up to 200 parts by weight and more for each 100 parts by weight of the blend. 
 Patents and patent application mentioned in this Specifi cation are incorporated by reference herein. 
 Molecular weights are weight average molecular weights 
 unless otherwise noted. 
 The invention is illustrated by the following examples. 
 EXAMPLES 1 to 6 
 The catalyst precursor used in example 1 is manufactured in two steps. In the first step, 390 gallons of tetrahydrofuran (THF) is added to a solution preparation vessel to which BHT (butylated hydroxytoluene) is added as an inhibitor to prevent peroxide formation. Then, 62.5 pounds of aluminum 
 reduced titanium trichloride TiCl, or one part TiCl to 3 parts AlCl (by weight) and 150 pounds of magnesium 
 chloride (MgCl) are added. The mixture is heated to a temperature of 65 to 75 degrees C., and held for a period of 
 4 hours to dissolve. The Solution is filtered to remove 
 insolubles. Then, 220 pounds of Silica are charged to the 
 vessel. The silica is slurried with the solution and the slurry is pumped to a jacketed holding tank maintained at a temperature of 35 degrees C. 
 The Second Step involves Spray drying the above slurry. This is accomplished by continuously feeding the slurry to a spray dryer. Hot nitrogen is circulated through the drying chamber, and the THF is evaporated leaving the TiCl/Mg Cl/THF/silica complex as a solid powder. The solids are then dropped into a slurry tank pre-loaded with dry mineral 
 oil. The slurry tank is then rolled for several hours to produce the catalyst used in example 1. It is Similar to the 
 catalysts described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,376,062 and 4.293, 
 673. 
 A magnesium/titanium alkoxide precursor, which is a Solid reaction product, is prepared according to illustrative 
 embodiment II from U.S. Pat. No. 5,124,298 carried out on a Scale Sufficient to obtain 300 pounds of granular material. Analysis (average of two runs): 12.3 percent Mg, 7.55 percent Ti, 60.3 percent OEt, 0.93 percent o-cresol (Cl= 11.5 percent by charge balance). 
 The activated precursor used in examples 2, 3, 5, and 6 is prepared as follows: US 6,248,831 B1 
 11 
 To a 10 gallon Stainless Steel reaction/filter vessel are charged 1,892 grams of magnesium/titanium alkoxide pre 
 cursor powder together with 3.5 kilograms of hexane. Then, a solution of 3.9 kilograms of SiCl, and 713 grams of TiCl in 6.6 kilograms of toluene is charged at Such a rate (15 to 20 minutes) as to keep the reaction temperature between 25 and 30 degrees C. The slurry is then stirred for 30 minutes and filtered through an internal filter plate. The solids are washed by re-slurrying in 15 kilograms of a 50/50 (by weight) mixture of hexane and toluene, and are then isolated by filtration. In like manner, the solids are washed twice with hexane and dried under moving nitrogen. The yield is 2,472 grams of yellow powder. Analysis: 10.7 weight percent Mg, 9.82 weight percent Ti; and 36.2 weight percent Cl. 
 The vessel is recharged with 1,302 grams of the yellow powder and 5 kilograms of hexane. Then, 7.291 grams of 25 weight percent ethylaluminum dichloride in toluene are added at Such a rate (15 minutes) as to keep the temperature between 25 and 30 degrees C. Then, 1,175 grams of 1 Molar BC1 in heptane are added all at once. After stirring for 30 minutes at 25 degrees C., the slurry is filtered. The solids are washed once with 50/50 (by weight) hexane/toluene, then twice with hexane and dried overnight under moving nitro gen as above. The yield is 1068 grams of dark brown powder. Analysis: 10.7 weight percent Mg; 9.62 weight percent Ti; 2.38 weight percent Al; and 56.7 weight percent Cl. A polymerization Sample is prepared by Slurrying 1.0 
 kilogram of the powder in 2.57 kilograms of mineral oil. 
 Example 1 is a comparative example and examples 2, 3, 
 5, and 6 represent high density and medium density embodi ments of the invention. Example 4 compares the examples 
 2 and 3 resins with the example 1 resin. 
 EXAMPLE 1. 
 About 85 pounds of polyethylene having a melt index of 1.0 gram per 10 minutes and a density of 0.920 gram per cubic centimeter made with the example 1 catalyst are charged to a first reactor as a Seedbed. About 120 pounds of polyethylene having a flow index of 0.5 gram per 10 minutes 
 and a density of 0.940 gram per cubic centimeter made with the example 1 catalyst are charged to a Second reactor as a 
 seed bed. Comonomers are ethylene and 1-hexene. Both reactors are then purged with high purity nitrogen at 80 
 degrees C. for Several hours until the moisture content is below 10 ppm. Then, about 1500 cubic centimeters of 5 weight percent triethylaluminum (TEAL) in isopentane is 
 charged to each reactor and circulated for a period of 4 hours. TEAL acts as a moisture Scavenger. The reactors are then given 2 high preSSure purges with nitrogen, and the 
 conditions set forth in Table I are established in each reactor:

 initiated at the rate of 7.5 cubic centimeters per hour using a slurry catalyst feeder. The ethylene partial pressure in the 15

 first reactor is manipulated to result in a production rate of 30 pounds per hour of resin. The H2/C2 molar ratio and C6/C2 molar ratio are manipulated in the first reactor to result in a resin with a flow index of 0.25 to 0.50 decigram per minute and a density of 0.927 to 0.930 gram per cubic centimeter. The Split in the resin exiting the Second reactor, i.e., the final product, is 60/40 (weight percent), i.e., 60 percent high molecular weight resin and 40 percent low molecular weight resin. This is accomplished by manipu lating the production rate of resin in the Second reactor, which is, in turn, accomplished by adjusting the ethylene partial pressure. The melt index of the final product is about 800 grams per 10 minutes and the density is about 0.963 per cubic centimeter. At a total production rate of 50 pounds per hour (HMW+LMW), a total of 1100 pounds of resin are produced. The bulk resin properties are set forth in Table II as follows. The bimodal product properties are given in the 
 Second reactor column.

 Approximately 1500 pounds of resin are produced in each of examples 1 to 3. 
 EXAMPLE 4. 
 Although the reactor conditions used in the examples are Somewhat different, the gas composition is adjusted So as to make products with Similar bulk properties. The product evaluations of the resins produced in examples 2 and 3, 
 however, result in films, which are Superior to the film produced from the resin of example 1. 
 Samples of the three resins are submitted for Size Exclu sion Chromatography (SEC) analysis. The SEC is per 
 formed with a WatersTM 150° C. analyzer with trichloroben Zene as Solvent at 140 degrees C. With a broad molecular weight distribution Standard and broad molecular weight 
 distribution calibration method. 
 Example 1: Mn=13,848 
 Mw-283,537 
 PDI-20.47 
 Examples 2 and 3: Mn=12,179 
 Mw-333,221 
 PDI-27.36 US 6,248,831 B1 
 15 
 The SECs reveal that the examples 2 and 3 products have 
 a broader molecular weight distribution than the example 1 
 product. It is noted that the broadening occurs in the high 
 molecular weight component. This is considered to be very 
 beneficial for bubble stability. 
 The resin Samples from examples 1 to 3 are compounded 
 on a LCM-100 line (Long Continuous Mixer/Gear Pump Pelletizing System (LCM-100 G) from Kobe Steel, Ltd. The 
 mixer is fitted with EL-2 type rotors from Same manufac 
 turer. Granular resin and additives are fed at room tempera 
 ture under controlled oxygen level at feed and vent ports. 
 The unit is typically run at 220 rpm, 10 to 40 percent gate 
 opening and mixer barrel temperature control). Precautions are taken to eliminate the possibility of tailoring (oxidative degradation) during the compounding step. The com 
 pounded resin Samples are then extruded in a 50 millimeter 
 Alpine TM film extruder having an 80 millimeter die and a 1.0 
 millimeter die gap, and evaluated. 
 The example 1 resin Sample runs at a maximum line Speed 
 of 105 feet per minute. The bubble is not stable at higher line Speeds and collapses. The dart impact Strength of this Sample 
 is measured at 240 grams on a 1 mil film. The film cannot be down gauged to 0.5 mill because of inferior bubble stability. These results verify that the precautions taken to avoid tailoring are adequate. 
 The examples 2 and 3 resin Samples demonstrate signifi cantly improved film properties. These samples run at a 
 maximum line Speed of 240 feet per minute. This represents 
 a 130 percent increase in bubble stability. The dart impact Strength of these Samples is measured at 290 grams on a 1 
 mil film. The film is Strong enough to be down gauged to 0.5 
 mil, and the dart impact Strength at 0.5 mil is measured at 305 grams. Both Samples result in Similar product proper 
 ties. 
 The Film Appearance Rating (FAR) is also very good, 
 ranging from plus 20 to plus 40, for the examples 2 and 3 resin samples and for the MDHMW (medium density, high molecular weight) resin Samples of example 5. Tensile Strength, Elmendorf tear, and percent elongation are also improved. 
 EXAMPLE 5 
 The catalyst of examples 2 and 3 is also used to produce two medium density high molecular weight film products. 
 The reactor conditions and proceSS control methodology are 
 Similar to that used above for examples 2 and 3 except that adjustments are made in order to produce medium density 
 resins as opposed to high density resins, and the results are 
 Similar also. 
 The two MDHMW resin samples also demonstrate sig nificantly improved film properties. These samples exhibit 
 maximum line Speeds greater than 325 feet per Second representing a greater than 210 percent increase in line Speed 
 over the example 1 resin Sample. The dart impact Strength of 
 these samples at 0.8 and 0.35 mil are 470 grams and 376 grams, respectively, resulting in a normalized dart impact 
 strength of 599 and 1069 grams, respectively, at 1 mil. 
 EXAMPLE 6 
 The following are the conditions and properties for four 
 runs in which MDHMW resins are made. The catalyst is the Same as the one used in examples 2, 3, and 5. See Tables IX, 
 X, XI, and XII. 1O

 Notes to above Tables: 
 1. Resin properties for Second reactor: These are theo retical values based on the assumption that the Second reactor copolymer is produced independently. In Some cases the bimodal resin properties are given, i.e., the properties of 
 the resin blend. 2. Density is measured by producing a plaque in accor dance with ASTM D-1928, procedure C, and then testing as is via ASTM D-1505. The density is reported in gram per 
 cubic centimeter. 3. production rate (lbS/hr)=the average resin production rate per hour based on a heat balance calculation (approximately equal to drum average production rate). 4.5% TEAL=5 weight percent triethylaluminum and 95 weight percent isopentane. 
 5. titanium split (%)=residual ppm Ti in Second reactor resin divided by residual ppm Ti in first reactor resin. This is an indirect measure of polymer Split. 6. SGV (ft/sec)=Superficial gas velocity in the bed. 
 7. The fluidized and settled bulk densities of each of the resins (not the blend) is given in pounds per cubic foot. 8. tap blowback=nitrogen is used to purge (blowback) the taps to avoid tap pluggage problems. 9. STY (Ibs/hr/cu ft)=Space/time/yield. This is equal to the resin production rate divided by the bed volume. 10. Split (energy balance)=production rate in first reactor 
 divided by the total production rate. The instantaneous production rate in each reactor is calculated by a heat 
 balance on the reactor. 
 12. Dart Drop is determined under ASTM D-1709, pro 
 cedure A. 
 13. Line Speed is the take off speed from an Alpine TM film 
 line equipped with a 100 millimeter die and a 1 millimeter die gap. The film is produced in stalk mode with a 4:1 BUR (blow-up ratio) and a 6 to 8 times die diameter frost line height at about 45 kilograms output rate per hour.

 POLYMERIZATION CATALYST AND METHOD 
 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 
 In this invention, the polymerization catalysts useful in polymerizing and copolymerizing 1-olefins are pre 
 pared by the reaction of silica or alumina with a func tional silane compound, organomagnesium compound, 
 an alcohol, and a titanium, vanadium, zirconium or mixture of these compounds. These catalysts are then activated, associating them with an organoaluminum cocatalyst. These catalyst products are primarily useful for the polymerization of 1-olefins such as ethylene and the copolymerization of these 1-olefins. One of the features of the invention is to provide an improved method of polymerizing with these catalysts in the particle form slurry, gas phase or solution form polymerization processes. 
 Another feature of the invention is that the polymeri zation reactions promoted by the improved catalysts are more readily modified by hydrogen so that desirable high melt index polymers are easily made. A further feature is that the higher melt index poly mers so produced are narrow in molecular weight dis tribution and are therefore highly suitable for injection molding or cast film applications. 
 Yet another feature of the invention is to provide a catalyst yielding high melt index, high density polyeth 
 ylene in the particle form process without reactor foul 
 1ng. 
 Still another feature of this invention is the produc tion of ethylene-1-alkene copolymers, commonly 
 known as linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), by the catalyst of this invention. These copolymers can have densities from 0.915 to 0.960 g/cm3 and properties suitable for film and injection molding applications, for example. 
 K. Ziegler first discovered two component catalysts based on compounds of the Group IVB-VIIB metals of the periodic table and an organometallic compound belonging to Groups I-IIIA of the periodic table for the polymerization of olefins. Since his discovery, numer ous catalysts have been disclosed as improvements over the original Ziegler catalysts. Most of these catalyst systems are of relatively low activity and stability. They require a costly catalyst removal step. 
 One of the modifications attempted in an effort to increase the activity of the Ziegler type catalyst was to deposit the catalyst components on an inert support. In 
 U.S. Pat. No. 2,981,725, such a process is disclosed. The supports used were magnesium chloride, silicon car bide, silica gel, calcium chloride, etc. The activity of the catalysts disclosed in these patents 
 was still low. 
 South Africa Applm. No. 69/3534, 10/5/69 by Van Den Berg and Tomiers of Stamicarbon describes cata lysts made from organomagnesium compounds, alkyl 
 aluminum chloride compounds, and titanium com pounds which are increased in reactivity by the addition of alcohols. A support, or granular ingredient, is not 
 used, there is no separation of the solvent, and the use of a cocatalyst is not disclosed. German Offen. No. 2,721,058, 11/23/78, by Gunter Schweier et al. of BASF reveals a catalyst with a po rous inorganic oxide like silica or silica-alumina as a support. A solution of a reaction mixture of an alcohol, a titanium trihalide, and : a magnesium compound is 
 added to the oxide, and then the solvent (i.e. the alco 2 
 hol) is evaporated giving an intermediate solid product.

 65 This solid product is suspended in a solution of an or ganometallic compound, which may be an alkyl alumi 
 num or silicon halide compound. The suspended solid component may be used as is along with an organome tallic compound as a cocatalyst. The suspended solid 
 compound can also be filtered, and washed prior to use, and for gas phase polymerization it can be coated with wax. The magnesium compounds are not alkyl magne 
 sium compounds but alkoxides and halides and other types of compounds. 
 Another Schweier patent, German Offen. No. 2,721,094 is similar to this one. It reveals that the silica or silica-alumina may be treated with an alkyl aluminum halide compound beforehand. 
 U.S. Pat. No. 4,110,523, 8/29/78, also by Schweier et al., covers a similar catalyst. In this case, the treatment with the alkyl aluminum or silicon halide solution is 
 eliminated. 
 U.S. Pat. No. 4,130,699, 12/19/78 by G. R. Hoff and Peter Fotis of Standard Oil Company discloses sup ported catalysts for vapor phase polymerization which 
 are made less active prior to feeding to the reaction vessel by treatment with alcohols, acetates, ketones, aldehydes, or esters. 
 U.S. Pat. No. 4,105,585, 8/8/78 by Ian Matheson of BP Chemicals describes catalysts prepared from the reaction of magnesium powder, a titanium halide and 
 alcohol. 
 U.S. Pat. No. 3,647,772 by N. Kashiwa (Mitsuit Pet rochemical, 5/7/72) involves treating anhydrous mag nesium carbonate with polar organic compounds in 
 cluding alcohols. When this is done, more titanium from titanium tetrachloride can be fixed upon the magnesium carbonate. Catalyst reactivity, melt index and bulk den sity of the product are increased by the treatment with the polar organic compound. 
 None of the above patents disclose the method and products of this invention. 
 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 
 The catalysts of this invention are formed from four 
 reactive materials. One of the reactive materials is the 
 product formed by the interaction of an oxide like silica or alumina with an organic silicon compound. This 
 silane-treated silica or alumina is combined with an 
 organomagnesium compound, an alcohol, and a tita nium or vanadium compound. From the resulting reac tion mixture, a solid, free-flowing catalyst is separated. The catalyst so formed is activated by an organoalumi num compound. 
 This invention provides novel catalysts, methods of making them and methods of polymerizing and copoly merizing 1-olefins. These catalysts are especially useful for the polymerization of ethylene to high density poly ethylene, and for the copolymerization of ethylene with 
 1-olefins for the formation of medium and low density copolymers. These improved catalysts are highly active 
 and are well suited for the economical and energy effi cient particle form and gas phase processes. Specifically, the object of this invention is to improve the well known Ziegler type catalyst by the method of this invention. These improved catalysts can be easily adapted to the particle form or gas phase process plants. 
 Polymers made using the invention catalysts can have 
 high MI and narrow molecular weight distribution. Thus, polymers well suited for injection molding and 4,374,753 3 rotational molding applications can be manufactured. The catalysts of this invention are stable, particulate, 
 and easy flowing. . . . . - 
 The alcohol modification allows the production of higher melt index polymers in response to the addition of hydrogen to the polymerization reaction. The silane treatment, in comparison with catalysts prepared with 
 out the silane treatment of the silica or alumina, leads to polymers of more narrow molecular weight distribu tions. The catalysts of this invention surprisingly retain both of these good features and are thus superior for the production of high melt index injection molding resins by ethylene polymerization. A totally unexpected advantage of the invention cata lysts is that they can produce ethylene-1-olefin copoly 
 mers (so-called LLDPE, linear low density polyethyl ene), with melt elasticity properties suitable for the manufacture of high strength blown film. The catalysts of this invention yield polymers with high melt index values at relatively low hydrogen con centration in the polymerization reaction. Thus, less hydrogen is required to obtain a given desired high melt index. This affords a savings on hydrogen and gives a higher reactivity because higher concentrations of hy drogen decrease the polymerization rate. The catalysts 
 of this invention give a relatively narrow molecular weight distribution at a given melt index. A narrow molecular weight distribution is desirable in polymers used for injection molding and in cast film applications because better strength is obtained. In the copolymerization of 1-olefins and ethylene to form low density copolymers of lower melt index, the catalysts of this invention can produce products with superior melt elasticity which is associated with high strength blown film. The catalysts of this invention are made from a com bination of silica or alumina, certain organic silicon compounds, an organomagnesium compound, an alco 
 hol, and a titanium compound. The catalysts are acti vated by an organoaluminum compound. 
 The silica or alumina materials may contain minor amounts of zirconia, magnesia, or titania. For catalyst manufacture, it is preferred to have relatively finely 
 divided silica or alumina, which may be porous or non 
 porous. The organic silicon compound must have at least one functional group which can react with the surface hy droxyl groups of the silica or alumina, and by means of this reaction the organic silicon residue must be bonded to the surface of the silica or alumina or mixtures of 
 these. Prior to the reaction between the organic silicon compound and the silica or alumina, the silica or alu mina may be dried to completely remove the water at a temperature less than about 800 C. The drying may be 
 only partial so as to leave a small amount of water to catalyze the reaction of the organic silicon compound with the surface groups. Usually, it is preferred to at least partially remove the surface water from the silica 
 or alumina. The amount of organic silicon compound may be in excess of the reactive surface groups. In this case, the conversion of the surface groups can be made as com plete as possible, and the unreacted excess can be re moved by distillation at less than 200° C., at pressures less than one atmosphere if necessary, or by heating combined with purging with an inert gas. The reaction product of the silica or alumina with the organic silicon compound should not be heated above 300 C., since 5

 decomposition of the bonded silane groups may occur. The amount of organic silicon compound may be less than the stoichiometric equivalent of the surface reac tive groups. In this case, no removal of excess is neces 
 sary. 
 The alcohols that are suitable for this invention con tain only one alcoholic hydroxyl group per molecule, and only carbon and hydrogen atoms in addition to the one oxygen atom. Phenols or alcohols with the hy droxyl directly bonded to an aromatic ring are not suit 
 able. 
 The alcohol can be added to the silane-treated silica or alumina immediately prior to the addition of the organomagnesium compound. The alcohol can also be added after the organomagnesium compound. It must, however, be combined into the catalyst mixture before the titanium compound. The reaction of the alcohol with the catalyst ingredi ents can be conducted at temperatures between 15° C. to about 100° C. but about room temperatures is com pletely satisfactory. 
 The amount of alcohol is chosen to give an alcohol to magnesium ratio between 0.1 to 5. Ratios higher than 2 * give less reactive catalysts and are not normally desired. Ratios less than 0.5 normally do not result in a sufficient increase in hydrogen response. A ratio of about 1.0 is preferred. 
 The amount of titanium compound is normally less than the amount equivalent to the reactive surface groups. However, the amount of titanium compound can vary from 5% to 200% of that equivalent amount. Trialkylaluminum compounds such as triethylalumi num and triisobutylaluminum are excellent cocatalysts. Alkyl aluminum hydrides like diisobutyl aluminum hy dride can be used. Mixtures of organoaluminum com pounds are suitable. An example is a combination of triisobutylaluminum and diethyl aluminum ethoxide. 
 The amount of cocatalyst is not critical. The molar ratio of organoaluminum cocatalyst to titanium com pound in the solid, free-flowing catalyst can range from 0.1/1 to 100/1. Preferably, the ratio is from 1/1 to 10/1. Activation of the catalyst with the cocatalyst can be accomplished within the polymerization reactor by the simultaneous feeding of both components. Alterna tively, the cocatalyst can be added to the catalyst prior to entry into the polymerization zone. 
 DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED 
 EMBODIMENTS 
 The catalysts of this invention have higher melt index capability and reactivity than normal Ziegler catalysts. These catalysts are simple to prepare and in the pre 
 ferred method, are highly economical because of the lack of necessity of calcination, solvent washing, high temperature reaction, grinding, etc. In this invention, the silicon compound has one or more reactive groups for each silicon atom in the mole cule. One of these reactive groups may be consumed by a surface reaction. Then the attached silicon atom may have no reactive group or it could have some reactive groups. The remaining reactive groups can interact with the magnesium component of the catalyst. By such interaction, the polymerization reactions can be influ enced toward desirable properties in the polymer prod 
 ucts. The silicon compounds useful in this invention have the following structural formulae: 4,374,753 
 RSixn 
 where m is 1, 2 or 3, n is 3, 2 or 1, respectively, and the total of m--n=4, X is a group chemically reactive with the hydroxyl groups of the silica or alumina such as chloride, amide, alkoxide, phenoxide and the like. The invention requires at least one such reactive group. If more than one are used, they may be the same or differ ent. Examples of reactive groups are -F, -Cl, --Br, 
 -OCH3, -OCH2CH5, -NH2, -NCCH3)2, -N(H- )Si(CH3)3, -CH2CH2CH2Cl, -CH2CH2CH2NH2, -OCH2CH2OCH3, -O2CCH3, . . . and -CH2CH2CH2SH. The R group is a hydrocarbon group containing only carbon and hydrogen. It may be, for example, alkyl, phenyl, or alkenyl such as vinyl. 
 The silicas or aluminas that are suitable for this inven 
 tion may contain minor amounts of zirconia, magnesia, or titania. For catalyst manufacture, it is preferred to have relatively finely divided silica or alumina, which may be porous or nonporous. . 
 Prior to reaction with the silane, the silica or alumina may be dried to completely remove surface water at a temperature less than 800° C. The drying may instead be only partial in some cases in order to leave a small amount of water, or the drying can be eliminated en tirely depending on the structure of the organosilane compound. Usually, it is preferred to at least partially remove the surface water from the silica or alumina. 6 possible to make high melt index particle form polyeth ylene with less hydrogen and at a lower polymerization temperature. The molar ratio of alcohol to magnesium alkyl is 0.1-5, most preferably 0.5-2.0. 5 The Group IVB and Group VB metals that are espe cially useful in this invention include titanium, zirco 
 nium and vanadium.

 5 in which m is 1, 2, 3 or 4, R2 is selected from alkyl, aryl, cycloalkyl, alkaryl, cyclopentadienyl and alkenyl, for example, ethenyl, propenyl and isopropenyl, each of 
 these groups having 1 to 12 carbon atoms, and X is halogen. When more than one R2 group occurs in the 20 titanium compound, the groups can be the same or different. Titanium tetrachloride is a preferred compound. The amount of titanium compound is preferably less than the amount equivalent to the surface reactive groups. 25 Nonetheless, this invention includes amounts of tita nium compound, which are from 1 to 200 percent of that equivalent amount. Following the reaction with the titanium compound, it is necessary to remove the excess solvent in order to For example, in the case of hexamethyl disilazane, a 30 have a free-flowing catalyst. In a preferred method,

This results in es sentially no reactor fouling and increases the bulk den The amount of silane compound may be in excess of sity of the product. Even through evaporation is the the reactive groups of silica or alumina surface. When preferred method of solvent removal, filtration, centri this is the case, the conversion of the surface groups can 35 fuging, or decantation can also be practiced. be made as complete as possible. The unreacted excess of silicon compound can be removed by distillation at less than 200 C. at decreased pressure if necessary, or by heat and inert gas purging. The reaction product of the silica or alumina with the silane should not be heated above 300 C., which might lead to thermal decomposition of the bonded silane groups. The amount of silane compound may also be less than the stoichiometric equivalent of the reactive groups upon the silica or alumina. In this case, all of the silane compound may become attached to the surface so that no removal of excess is necessary. The organomagnesium compounds useful in this in vention are the alkyls or aryls of magnesium.or.its com plexes such as complexes with alkyl aluminum com pounds. The structural formulae of some preferred compounds are R2MgX1, R'2Mg and (R22Mg). AlR32 where R2 is alkyl containing 1-10 carbon atoms or aryl such as phenyl, naphthyl and cyclopentadienyl and n is 
 0.5-10. X is a halide such as chloride or bromide. Com plexes of organomagnesium compounds with organo 
 aluminum halides can also be used. The complexes may contain small amounts of aluminum or magnesium al 
 koxides. The amount of organomagnesium compound added 60 to make the catalysts of this invention is determined by the amount of titanium compound. Normally, the Mg/Tiratio is from 0.1 to 5, most preferably 1.0. The addition of alcohol to the catalyst preparation is before the tetravalent titanium compound but can be before or after the addition of magnesium alkyl. The catalyst of this invention has an enhanced sensitivity to molecular weight control by hydrogen. This makes it 45 
 50 The alkyl aluminum cocatalyst can be chosen from trialkyl aluminum compounds and alkyl aluminum hy dride compounds and their mixtures. The alkyl groups of suitable cocatalysts have hydrocarbon chains con 
 40 taining one or about ten carbon atoms and may be straight chained or branched. Triaryl aluminum com pounds may also be used but because they are not so readily obtained as the alkyl compounds, they are not preferred. Examples of suitable cocatalysts are triethyl 
 aluminum, trioctyl aluminum, tri(2-methyl pentyl )aluminum and diethyl aluminum hydride. Trisobutyl aluminum and diisobutylaluminum hydride are espe cially preferred. If needed, alkyl aluminum halides may be used along with the alkyl aluminum compounds 
 described above. 
 The cocatalyst may be fed to the polymerization 
 reactor along with the above-described solid compo nent in the same or preferably separate lines. The molar is ratio of the cocatalyst to the Group IVB and VB metal compounds in the solid component can be from 0.1:1 to 100:1 although the preferred range is 1:1 to 20:1. When using the catalyst according to the invention, at least one 1-olefin of the formula R6-CH=CH2, where R6 is hydrogen or a straight chain or branched alkyl radical having from 1 to 10, preferably from 1 to 8, carbon atoms is polymerized. Examples of such ole ...fins are ethylene, propylene, butene-1, hexene-1, 4 methyl-pentene-1, octene-1. 65. The polymerization may be carried out in suspension, solution or in the gaseous phase, continuously or dis continuously, at a temperature of from 20-300' C, preferably from 60-110' C., under a pressure of from   4,374,753 7 
 atmospheric to 10,000 psi gauge. It is carried out prefer ably under the technically interesting pressure in the 
 range of from 300-800 psi. The melt index of the polyethylene produced by the 
 invention catalyst can be controlled by methods known to the art such as increasing the temperature of poly merization or by the addition of hydrogen. These cata lysts show relatively high activity in ethylene polymeri zation and copolymerization. The polymers can be eas 
 ily blended with antioxidants and pelletized for com mercial use. High partial pressures of hydrogen can be used to yield very high melt index products. The catalysts are useful for producing polymers of 
 1-olefins of 2 to 8 carbon atoms and copolymers of these 
 with 1-olefins of 2 to 20 carbon atoms to form solid polymers or copolymers. 
 EXAMPLES 
 EXAMPLE 1 
 A catalyst was made with silica treated with hex amethyl disilazane and with the addition of n-butyl alcohol. A control catalyst was made without the addi tion of the alcohol for comparison. Davison Chemical grade 952 silica was treated with hexamethyl disilazane. A 2.6 g quantity of the treated silica was transferred to a dry, nitrogen-filled flask. The silica was stirred with a magnet bar for one hour while a flow of N2 was passed through the flask. Then 7.7 ml of dibutyl magnesium-triethyl aluminum complex 
 (Mg/Al=6.1) solution, 8.9 wt.% in heptane, 0.59 ml n-butyl alcohol, and 16.25 ml of heptane were added sequentially. The combination was kept at room tem perature, under continuous N2 flow, and stirring for 30 
 minutes. Then 0.36 ml titanium tetrachloride was 
 added, and the combination stirred an additional 30 minutes at room temperature. The flask was immersed in a constant temperature bath at 90° C. until the hep tane was evaporated and carried away by the N2 stream. The catalyst remained in the flask as a free-flowing, light-yellow colored powder. The catalysts were tested for ethylene polymerization 
 at 215 F. with 500 ml isobutane in a 1400 ml vessel. 
 Triisobutyl aluminum (TIBAL) solution in an amount of 9.2 mmoles per gram of catalyst was added for each test. The total pressure was 550 psig in each case. The following results were obtained:

 EXAMPLE 2 
 Another catalyst was made as described in Example 1 except that the proportions of magnesium compound, 
 butyl alcohol, and titanium chloride were increased relative to the silane-treated silica. In this example, the amount of titanium tetrachloride was 1.75 mmol per gram of silane-treated silica instead of 1.25 mmol per gram. The Ti/Mg and alcohol to magnesium ratios were kept equal to 1.0. For comparison, a catalyst was made in the same way 
 but without the addition of the n-butyl alcohol. O

During the polymerization tests, ethylene was fed as required to keep the total pressure constant at 550 psig. TIBAL at 9.2 mmoles per gram was the catalyst. The tests showed that the invention catalyst gave a much higher melt

 Another test of the catalyst of Example 2 was done in the 2 l pressure vessel but with only 50 psi hydrogen 
 added instead of 100 psi. This test gave an hourly catalyst reactivity of 5052 
 with the product having a melt index of 2.4 and an RD value of 3.6. Previously, a comparison catalyst had been 
 made in a similar way but without silane-treated silica. in place of the silane-treated Davison 952 silica, ther mally treated silica was used. The temperature of treat ment was 600 C. This comparison catalyst gave an hourly reactivity of 224.5, a melt index of 3.0, and an RD 
 value of 4.5. The RD value is a measure of molecular 
 weight distribution and was measured as described in the article in Polymer Engineering and Science, Vol. II, pages 124-128 (1971). The lower RD value of the poly mer produced by the invention catalyst shows the prod uct to be more suitable for injection molding applica 
 tions. 
 EXAMPLE 4 
 The two catalysts of Example 2 were tested for ethy lene-butene copolymerization in a 1400 ml pressure vessel. In each case a sample of the catalyst, a volume of 25 wt.% triisobutyl aluminum solution and 500 ml of isobutane were introduced into the polymerization wes sel. The amount of trisobutyl aluminum solution was chosen to give 9.2 mmol/g of solid catalyst. The tem perature of polymerization was 160' F. After the isobu tane addition, hydrogen was added to give a 50 psi increase in pressure. Ethylene and 1-butene were then metered in over a period of five to seven minutes. Eth ylene was added as required to give a total pressure of 
 350 psig while the amount of 1-butene added was ap proximately 22 wt.% of the reaction vessel contents. 
 The reactions were continued for one hour after the 350 
 psig total pressure was attained. During this hour an additional 15 g quantity ofbutene was added to replace the portion polymerized. 
 The results of the tests showed that the invention catalyst gave a low density copolymer with superior melt elasticity. The invention catalyst also gave a higher melt index and reactivity:

 EXAMPLE'S 
 A catalyst was made in the same manner as described in Example 1 except that a different magnesium com pound was used. A 1.8g quantity of hexamethyldisila 
 Zane-treated silica was combined in a nitrogen atmo sphere with 20 ml of heptane and 5.7 ml of abutyl octyl magnesium solution in heptane. The quantity of butyl octyl magnesium was 2.25 mmoles. The combination was stirred one half hour at room temperature, then 0.21 ml of n-butyl alcohol was added. This mixture was stirred for one half hour. A 0.25 ml volume of titanium tetrachloride was added as small drops from a syringe to form the catalyst slurry. The slurry was kept at room temperature for another thirty minutes, then the flask 
 was immersed in an oil bath at 100 C. The flask was 
 kept in the bath for 30 minutes at the end of which time the solvents had evaporated leaving a free-flowing 
 solid. 
 Another catalyst was made with the butyl octyl mag nesium solution in the same way except that the n-butyl alcohol was omitted. 
 The two catalysts were tested under identical condi tions as described in Example 2, in a 21 polymerization vessel with 100 psi hydrogen at 215 F. The results show that the alcohol catalyst gave polyethylene of higher melt index.

 EXAMPLE 6 
 This example shows the use of another magnesium compound. A catalyst was prepared with the addition of n-butyl alcohol in the same way as the catalyst of Example 5 except that a dibutyl magnesium solution was added instead of the butyl octyl magnesium solu tion. The dibutyl magnesium solution was obtained from the Lithium Corporation of America. In this prod uct, a portion of butyl groups are secondary butyl groups and the remainder are normal butyl groups. A polymerization test was conducted as in Example 5 giving polyethylene with a melt index of 49 and a reac tivity of 1463 g/g cat. hr. 
 EXAMPLE 7 
 In this example, the molar ratio of the alcohol to the magnesium compound was varied. Three catalysts were made with the addition of n-butyl alcohol as described in Example 5 but with different amounts of alcohol. Also, in this case, butyl ethyl magnesium was used as the magnesium compound. The amount of butyl ethyl magnesium solution for each of the three catalysts was 1.25 mmoles per gram of the hexamethyldisilazane 
 treated silica. The amount of titanium tetrachloride was 
 also 1.25 mmoles per gram in each case. However, the volume of n-butyl alcohol added was varied as shown 10

 EXAMPLE 8 
 This example shows the preparation of a catalyst with aMg/Tiatomic ratio of 0.5 instead of the Mg/Tiatomic ratio of 1.0 in previous examples. The procedure for preparation was the same as in Example 5, and butyl ethyl magnesium was the magnesium compound. A 2.1 
 g quantity of the silane-treated silica was transferred to the dry, N2-purged flask. A 20 ml volume of heptane and 1.91 ml of the butyl ethyl magnesium solution were combined with the silica. With reaction periods as in Example 5, 0.11 ml n-butyl alcohol and 0.29 ml of tita nium tetrachloride were added. The solvent was evapo rated by heating at 100° C. for 50 minutes. In the poly merization test at 215 F. with 100 psi H2, polyethylene with a melt index of 36 was produced. The reactivity of the catalyst was 2471 g/g cat. hr. TIBAL solution at 9.2 mmoles per gram of catalyst was again employed as the cocatalyst. 
 EXAMPLE 9 
 This example shows that the magnesium to titanium atomic ratio can be greater than 1.0 in the invention catalyst. The procedure and ingredients were the same as in Example 8 but the Mg/Tiatomic ratio was 1.5, the butyl ethyl magnesium to n-butyl alcohol molar ratio 
 was 1.0, and the titanium tetrachloride was 1.25 mmoles per gram of silane-treated silica. The catalyst was tested for the synthesis of a 1 butene-ethylene copolymer as described in Example 4. 
 The reactivity was found to be 4364 g/g cat. hr. The melt index of the product was 2.9 and its density was 0.927. 
 The catalyst was also tested in the particle form syn thesis of polyethylene as described in Example 2. The melt index of the homopolymer was 57, and the reactiv ity of the catalyst under the given conditions was 1917 g/g cat. hr. 
 EXAMPLE 10 
 A catalyst was prepared as in Example 1 except that benzyl alcohol was added to the preparation instead of butyl alcohol. The catalyst was tested in ethylene butene copolymerization as described in Example 2. The catalyst reactivity was 1321 g/g cat. per hour, and 
 the melt index was 2.6. 
 EXAMPLE 11 
 A quantity of Davison Chemical Company grade 952 
 silica was first dried at 300 C. in a bed fluidized by nitrogen. A 1.3 g quantity of the dried silica was trans ferred to a flask, and combined with 15 ml hexane and 0.24 ml of allyldimethylchlorosilane. The amount of allyldimethylchlorosilane was 1.25 mmoles per gram of 
 silica. The combination was stirred in an inert atmo 
 sphere at room temperature for 30 minutes. At this 4,374,753 
stage, volatile materials were evaporated in a nitrogen 11 
stream by immersing the flaskin a bath at 100° C. Upon cooling, 15 ml hexane and 3.9 ml of dibutyl magnesium triethylaluminum complex solution (Mg/Al=6.1) were 
 added. After 30 minutes, 0.15 ml of n-butyl alcohol was added. The molar ratio of alcohol to dibutyl magnesium 
 was calculated to be 1.0. After an additional 30 minutes, 
 0.13 ml of titanium tetrachloride was added. The sol 
 vents were evaporated in a nitrogen stream at 100 C. The dry catalyst was white. 
 The catalyst was tested with triisobutyl aluminum cocatalyst in ethylene-butene copolymerization as de 
 scribed in Example 2. The reactivity was 2735 g/g cat. per hour, the melt index was 4.8, and the density was 
 0.919. 
 This example shows that allyldimethyl chlorosilane can be the silane compound. 
 EXAMPLE 12 
 The catalyst of Example 11 was tested in ethylene hexene copolymerization. The procedure was similar to 
 that described in Example 2. Instead of about 22 wt.% 
 butene, about 26 wt.% 1-hexane was added. Also, in stead of a total pressure of 350 psig, the pressure in this test was 300 psig. The product was recovered as particles. Its melt index was 6.5, and its density was 0.924. The catalyst reactivity was 2095 g/g cat. per hour. This example shows that low density ethylene-hexene 
 copolymers can be made with the catalyst of this inven 
 tion. 
 EXAMPLE 13 
 A catalyst was prepared in Example 11 except that an equimolar amount of n-dodecyl trichlorosilane was substituted for the allyldimethylchlorosilane. This catalyst was tested in ethylene-butene copoly merization as described in Example 2. The product 5

 EXAMPLE 14 
 Again, a catalyst was made as in Example 11, but with a different silane compound. The silane compound was N,O-bis-(trimethylsilyl)acetamide. In an ethylene 
 butene copolymerization test like Example 2, the reac 
 tivity was found to be 2010 g/g cat. per hour. 
 EXAMPLE 15 
 A catalyst was made as in Example 11, but with N trimethylsilyl diethylamine. In ethylene-butene copoly 
 merization, the reactivity was found to be 3351 g/g cat. per hour. 
 EXAMPLE 16 
 In this example the order of addition of the catalyst components is different. Davison Chemical grade 952 silica was treated with hexamethyldisilazane. Prior to catalyst preparation, this treated silica was heated at 100° C. for one hour in flowing nitrogen. To 2.0 g of the treated silica, 20 ml of hexane and 0.23 ml of n-butyl 
 alcohol were added. The combination was stirred for 30 minutes, then 5.94 ml of a dibutyl magnesium triethyl aluminum complex solution was added (Mg/Al=6.1). The concentration was 8.9 wt.%, and the solvent was heptane. After another 30 minutes, 0.28 ml of titanium tetrachloride was added. The liquids were evaporated 45

For butene copolymerizations, the total pressure was 350 psig, and for hexene copolymeriza tion, it was 300 psig, Hydrogen to give a 50 psi increase in pressure was added to the isobutane, which was the 
 solvent in each test.

The reactions were continued for one hour after the 350 psig total pressure was attained. During this hour an additional 15 g quantity of butene was added to replace the portion polymerized. The results of the tests showed that the invention catalyst gave a low density copolymer with superior melt elasticity.

 0001. The present invention relates to a solid catalyst component for ethylene polymerization and copolymeriza 
 tion, composed of a carrier of particulate silica and a catalytically active portion including titanium, magnesium, 
 chlorine, alkoxy groups and at least one organometallic 
 compound of the groups 1, 2, 12 or 13 of the periodic table. The process for obtaining the catalyst of the present inven 
 tion comprises the steps of 
 0002 (a) impregnating an activated silica In particles using a solution of an organometallic compound of the 
 groups 1, 2, 12 or 13 of the periodic table, in an inert organic solvent; 
 0003) (b) removing the supernatant liquid from the step 
 (a): 
 0004 (c) preparing a solution obtained by reacting at least one magnesium compound, selected from mag 
 nesium halides and magnesium alkoxides and at least 
 one titanium compound selected from titanium alkox ides and titanium halogen alkoxides; 
 0005 (d) impregnating the silica obtained on (b) using 
 the solution prepared in (c); 
 0006 (e) optionally reacting the solid obtained In (d) with a reducing agent; 
 0007 (f) reacting the solid obtained in (d) or (e) with a halogenating agent; 
 0008 (g) treating thermally the solid obtained in (f); 
 0009 (h) washing the solid obtained in (g) with an inert organic solvent; 
 0010 (i) optionally, washing the solid obtained in (h) 
 with a solution of one or more organometallic com pounds of the groups 1, 2, 12 or 13 of the periodic table. 
 0011. The catalyst component obtained is especially suit able for the production of homo- and copolymers of ethylene 
 as narrow molecular weight distribution high density poly ethylene and linear low density polyethylene with controlled morphology and improved properties. 
 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 
 1) Polymerization Process 
 0012. The slurry or gas phase processes for the produc 
 tion of HDPE or LLDPE operating with low bulk density 
 polymer need reactors with large Volumes in order to obtain the necessary residence time. Particularly, in the gas phase 
 reactors the presence of fines with low bulk density causes 
 troubles. In fact, due to the friction of the polymer particles present into the reactor the fines are especially prone to the 
 formation of electrostatic charges and tend to deposit and adhere to the metallic walls. These stagnant deposits does 
 not allow the exchange of the reaction heat and become hot spots, which can form layer of agglomerates containing 
 eventually melt polymer. After some time chunks of agglomerates can fall down and plug the product discharge 
 system. The described effects are enhanced when the reac tion is carried out with a highly active catalyst. Jul. 27, 2006 
 0013. In the U.S. Pat. No. 5,410,002 a summary of patents on the above described phenomena is presented. 
 0014. Therefore, it is crucial for the process that the catalyst used enables a total control of the polymer mor phology resulting in product grains without fines, with high bulk density and good flowing properties. 
 0015. Another very important aspect is that the catalyst 
 must have a slow decaying time to permit the use of reactors 
 in series. This arrangement makes possible the obtainment 
 of bimodal products in addition the reduction of the total 
 volume of reaction for the same production basis. Moreover, process operation with a different condition of reaction in at 
 least two reactors in series, turns possible the use of catalysts with higher particle size thereby minimizing the formation 
 of electrostatic charges. 
 2) Polymer Structure 
 0016. The catalyst properties are fundamental to the polymer structure, mainly in respect of the molecular weight 
 distribution, comonomer insertion in the polymeric chain 
 and soluble content. 
 0017. Each application used to achieve a final product 
 from high density polyethylene (HDPE) or linear low den sity polyethylene (LLDPE) requires a specific polymeric 
 Structure. 
 0018 To obtain a film with improved optical and mechanical properties and avoid blocking problems, a poly 
 mer having narrow molecular weight distribution (MFR-27), is required. A large quantity of LLDPE appli cations requires products with density=0.918 and MI=0.7. 
 and in most cases a xylene soluble content<10% is desired. Indeed, when the xylene soluble content of the polymer is 
 present in a high concentration (>10%) and with a low 
 molecular weight, this soluble tends to migrate to the film Surface causing blocking, in addition to the unsatisfactory 
 optical properties (low gloss and high haze). 
 3) Ziegler-Natta polyethylene catalyst 
 0019. Due to the strong competition existent in the poly ethylene market, the catalyst production cost is a fundamen 
 tal component. Therefore it is mandatory that the catalyst for producing polyethylene be manufactured by a simple route, 
 from low cost raw material, without generating gaseous, 
 liquid or solid effluents hard to treat. 
 0020. The patent U.S. Pat. No. 5,188,997 describes a synthesis process for Ziegler-Natta catalysts from silica and 
 magnesium chloride alcoholate. The results reported dem 
 onstrate that this catalyst produces a polymer with low bulk 
 density (0.23 to 0.30 g/ml) and with an intermediate molecu 
 lar weight distribution (MFR 30.0 to 37.8). 
 0021. The patent U.S. Pat. No. 5,585.317 describes the synthesis of a catalyst Supported on a magnesium chloride 
 based carrier. The reported examples relates to the produc tion of polymers having good morphology, characterized by 
 the absence of fines and by the high bulk density which is for 
 LLDPE produced between 0.32 and 0.40 g/ml and for HDPE 
 between 0.33 and 0.438 g/ml. 
 0022. However, in the case of LLDPE production, the 
 polymer obtained presents an undesired comonomer distri 
 bution in its chain, evidenced by the high xylene soluble 
 content at different polymer densities. As an example, a US 2006/0166812 A1 
 polyethylene with 0.919 g/ml of polymer density has a 
 xylene soluble content of 12.5% by weight. 
 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 
 0023 The present invention relates to a solid catalyst component for ethylene polymerization and copolymeriza 
 tion, composed of a carrier of particulate silica and a catalytically active portion Including titanium, magnesium, 
 chlorine, alkoxy groups and at least one organometallic 
 compound of the groups 1, 2, 12 or 13 of the periodic table. 
 The process for obtaining the catalyst of the present Inven tion comprises the steps of 
 0024 (a) impregnating an activated silica in particles using a solution of an organometallic compound of the 
 groups 1, 2, 12 or 13 of the periodic table, in an inert organic solvent; 
 0025 (b) removing the supernatant liquid from the step 
 (a): 
 0026 (c) preparing a solution obtained by reacting at least one magnesium compound, selected from mag 
 nesium halides and magnesium alkoxides and at least 
 one titanium compound selected from titanium alkox 
 ides and titanium halogen alkoxides; 
 0027 (d) impregnating the silica obtained on (b) using 
 the solution prepared in (c); 
 0028 (e) optionally reacting the solid obtained in (d) with a reducing agent; 
 0029 (f) reacting the solid obtained in (d) or (e) with a halogenating agent; 
 0030 (g) treating thermally the solid obtained in (f); 
 0031 (h) washing the solid obtained in (g) with an inert organic solvent; 
 0032 (I) optionally, washing the solid obtained in (h) 
 with a solution of one or more metal-alkyl halide compounds of the groups 1, 2, 12 or 13 of the periodic 
 table. 
 0033. Therefore, the present Invention provides a catalyst especially suitable for the production of ethylene homo- and 
 copolymers as narrow molecular weight distribution high density polyethylene (NMWHDPE) and linear low density 
 polyethylene (LLDPE) with controlled morphology and improved properties. 
 0034 Additionally, the catalyst described and claimed in 
 the present invention produces a NMWHDPE with a melt 
 flow ratio (MFR) lower than 27 that are particularly suitable for thermoforming and injection applications. 
 0035) Further, the catalyst described and claimed in the present invention produces a LLDPE with a low xylene 
 soluble content due to the very good comonomer insertion allowing the production of films with Superior optical prop 
 erties and very low blocking. 
 0036) The present invention provides still a catalyst that 
 provides, when Submitted to polymerization conditions, particles of ethylene homo and copolymers having high bulk 
 density and containing a very Small quantity of fines. Jul. 27, 2006 
 0037. The present invention provides additionally a cata lyst useful in liquid phase or in gas phase, ethylene poly 
 merization process. 
 0038. The present invention provides further a catalyst useful in polymerization process due to its high activity and 
 low decay kinetics.

 0064. In general, when preparing the solution of the step 
 (c), titanium is used in Such an amount that the molar ratio Ti/Mg varies within the range of 0.3 to 4, and preferably 
 within the range of 0.5 to 2. 
 0065. In step (d) the silica obtained on step (b) is sus pended in an inert organic solvent, Such as a hydrocarbon 
 solvent of the aliphatic type, preferably the same used in the previous steps and the dissolved product prepared on Step (c) 
 is added to the Suspension. The impregnation is carried out by Suspending 100 parts by weight of silica, obtained on step 
 (b), for each 5 to 200 parts by volume of the component 
 prepared on Step (c) and after dilution in the inert organic 
 Solvent. The Suspension is maintained under stirring at a temperature that ranges from room temperature to the boil 
 ing point of the mixture, preferably at 60° C., over a period 
 of time from 30 to 180 minutes, preferably between 50 and 60 minutes. In this way a solid component Suspended in an 
 inert organic solvent is obtained. 
 0066. Optionally the solid component obtained in step (d) 
 can be submitted to reducing conditions in a step (e). Said result is obtained, for example, by using reducing agents, Such as Na-alkyls, Li-alkyls, Zn-alkyls, Mg-alkyls and cor responding aryl-derivatives, Grignard compounds of the 
 type RMgX, wherein R represents a linear or branched alkyl group, containing from 1 to 10 carbons or aryl-derivatives 
 and X represents a halogen atom and preferably a chlorine atom, Al-alkyl halide compounds or by using reducing 
 agents such as silicon compounds. Particularly effective silicone compounds are the polymethylhydrosiloxanes in 
 which the monomer unit has the general formula HSiR O— wherein R is H. halogen, alkyl with I to 10 carbon 
 atoms, aryl with 6 to 10 carbon atoms, alkoxyl with 1 to 10

 or aryl-silanes (RSiH, in which R is alkyl or aryl and X is a number varying from 1 to 3) and alkoxy-silanes or aryloxy-silanes (ROSiRI, in which R is alkyl or aryland 
 X is a number varying from 1 to 3). 
 0068 The reducing agent chosen from the above examples, preferably polymethylhydrosiloxanes (PMHS), is 
 added to the solid obtained in the step (d), dissolved pref erably in the same inert organic solvent used for the reaction Suspension. This addition is carried out slowly over a period 
 of time from 30 to 180 minutes, preferably between 50 and 
 80 minutes and the Solid Suspension is maintained under stirring at a temperature ranging from room temperature to 
 the boiling point of the aliphatic hydrocarbon used as 
 solvent, preferably at 60° C. 
 0069. The amount of reducing agent that can be used in step (e) corresponds to the amount ranging from 0 to 2 moles 
 per mole of titanium, preferably between 0 and 0.1 mole per 
 mole of titanium. It has been observed, in the experiments, Jul. 27, 2006 
 that the quantity used of this reducing agent can control the 
 amount of titanium fixed on silica at the final catalyst. 
 0070. In the next step of the process according to the 
 present invention, the Suspension obtained in (d) or (e), 
 which is still under stirring, is put in contact and interacted with one or more halogenating agents. 
 0071 Halogenating agents useful in the practice of the 
 present invention can be either liquid or gaseous materials, 
 pure or preferably dissolved in an inert organic solvent. Representative but non-exhaustive examples of halogenat 
 ing agents useful in the present invention are methylalumi num dichloride, methylaluminum sesquichloride, isobutyla 
 luminum dichloride, isobutylaluminum sesquichloride, 
 ethylaluminum dichloride (EADC), diethylaluminum chlo 
 ride (DEAC), ethylaluminum sesquichloride (EASC), SiCl, 
 SnCl4, HCl, Cl, HSiCl, aluminum chloride, ethylboron dichloride, boron chloride, diethylboron chloride, HCC1, PCls, POCl, acetyl chlorides, thionyl chloride, sulfur chlo 
 ride, methyl trichlorosilane, dimethyl dichlorosilane, TiCl, 
 VC1, CC1, t-butyl chloride, n-butyl chloride, chloroform, 
 1,1,1-trichloroethane, 1,1,2-trichloroethane, 1,2-dichloroet

 0072 The preferred halogenating agents are chlorinating 
 agents and of these SiCl, SnCl4, HCl, Cl, HSiCl, methyl 
 trichlorosilane, dimethyl dichlorosilane, t-butyl chloride, 
 n-butyl chloride, chloroform, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, 1,1,2- 
 trichloroethane, 1,2-dichloroethane and dichloromethane are preferred, most preferably SiCla. 
 0073. The amount of halogenating agent used in the step (e of the process corresponds to the amount ranging from 0.5 
 to 3 moles of halogenating agent per mole of titanium, 
 preferably between 1 and 1.8 moles of halogenating agent 
 per mole of titanium. 
 0074 The time necessary for halogenating Ti-alkoxide 
 and optionally Mg-alkoxide varies from 0.5 hour to 5 hours, 
 preferably from 1.5 hours to 2.5 hours. The temperature of the Solid Suspension halogenation ranges from room tem perature to the boiling point of the aliphatic hydrocarbon 
 used as solvent, preferably at 60° C. 
 0075 According to the present invention, in step (g) of 
 the process, the solid obtained in (f) is kept under higher temperature that depends on the inert organic solvent used. 
 0076. The time necessary for this thermal treatment of the 
 solid obtained in step (f) ranges from 0.5 hour to 5 hours, preferably from 3 to 5 hours. The ideal temperature for this 
 purpose depends on the organic solvent used and it can be 
 conducted from 60° C. to 120° C., preferably from 60° C. to 
 75° C., when hexane is used as the organic solvent. 
 0077. At the step (h) after the thermal treatment, the solid can be separated from the Suspension, for example by 
 settling and siphoning, filtration or centrifugation, washed 
 with an inert organic solvent, preferably hexane, and then dried. The washing temperature can vary from room tem perature to the boiling point of the aliphatic hydrocarbon 
 used as solvent, preferably at room temperature. 
 0078. Optionally, the solid obtained in (h) is washed with a solution of organometallic compounds of the groups 1, 2, 
 12 or 13. More specifically, in the optional step (i) the solid 
 obtained in step (h) is suspended in an inert organic solvent 
 Such as hexane or heptane, and it is put in contact with one US 2006/0166812 A1 
 or more organometallic compounds of the groups 1, 2, 12 or 13 of the periodic table, preferably metal-alkyl compounds 
 or metal-alkyl halide compounds belonging to these groups, 
 in special aluminum, magnesium, lithium and Zinc com pounds. Specific examples of these compounds are methy 
 laluminum dichloride, methylaluminum sesquichloride, isobutylaluminum dichloride, isobutylaluminum ses 
 quichloride, ethylaluminum dichloride (EADC), diethylalu 
 minum chloride (DEAC), ethylaluminum sesquichloride (EASC), tri-n-hexylaluminum (Tn-HAL), tri-n-octylalumi 
 num (TnOAL). They can be used concentrated or preferably 
 dissolved in the above organic solvent or in a different organic solvent chosen from aliphatic hydrocarbons. The 
 process is carried out at a temperature ranging from room 
 temperature to the boiling point of the organic solvent used 
 as solvent, preferably at room temperature, for a period of 
 time that can vary from 10 minutes to 24 hours, preferably 
 from 40 minutes to 5 hours. 
 0079 When using more than one organometallic com pound in the step (i), the different compounds can be fed in 
 the same solution or in individual Solutions, at the same time or in Subsequent additions. 
 0080. The amount of the metal-alkyl halide compound of the groups 1, 2, 12 or 13 or metal-alkyl compound of the 
 groups 1, 2, 12 or 13, used in the step (i) of the process 
 corresponds to the amount ranging from 0 to 3 g of the corresponding metal-alkyl halide compound of the groups 1, 
 2, 12 or 13 or metal-alkyl compound of the groups 1, 2, 12 or 13, per g of dry catalyst component obtained, preferably 
 between 0.05 and 1 g of the corresponding metal-alkyl 
 halide compound of the groups 1, 2, 12 or 13 or metal-alkyl compound of the groups 1, 2, 12 or 13, per g of dry catalyst 
 component obtained. 
 0081. The use of inert organic solvents, most specifically aliphatic hydrocarbons, in all process steps of the present 
 invention brings another important feature to the Solid catalyst component characteristics. The Solid catalyst com 
 ponent obtained is completely free of residual polar sol 
 vents, such as ethanol, and their derivatives in its final composition. 
 0082 The titanium amount that remains fixed on the solid catalyst component may reach up to 10% by weight, 
 expressed as the Ti metal content, and it is preferably 
 comprised between 0.5 and 2% by weight. 
 0083. The magnesium amount that remains fixed on the Solid catalyst component may reach up to 6% by weight, 
 expressed as the Mg metal content, and it is preferably 
 comprised between 0.3 and 3.0% by weight. 
 0084. The chlorine amount that remains fixed on the solid catalyst component may reach up to 20% by weight, 
 expressed as the C1 contents, and it is preferably between 5 and 12% by weight. 
 0085. The alkoxy amount that remains fixed on the solid catalyst component may reach up to 20% by weight and it 
 is preferably between 3 and 8% by weight. 
 0.086 The amount of organometallic compound of the 
 groups 1, 2, 12 or 13 that remains fixed on the Solid catalyst component may reach up to 5% by weight, expressed as the 
 metal contents, and it is preferably between 0.3 and 3% by weight. This organometallic compound of the groups 1, 2, Jul. 27, 2006 
 12 or 13 are metal-alkyl compounds or metal-alkyl halide compounds belonging to these groups, in special organoalu 
 minum, organomagnesium, organolithium and organozinc 
 compounds, pure or in mixtures. 
 0087. The particle size distribution of the solid catalyst component of the present invention is very close to the silica used as carrier and, as consequence, its average particle size 
 ranges also from 10 to 120 um. The solid catalyst component surface area ranges from 80 to 300 m/g and its pore volume ranges from 0.1 to 1.0 ml/g. 
 0088. The catalyst component of the present invention is Suitable for using in liquid phase or gas phase, ethylene polymerization process. The co-catalyst used in the poly 
 merization process is an alkyl-aluminum, preferably trim 
 ethyl aluminum or triethyl aluminum. The mass ratio co catalyst: catalyst in the polymerization process is between 
 0.5:1 and 6.0:1. 
 0089 An important feature is its ability to produce, when 
 Submitted to polymerization conditions, particles of homo and copolymers of ethylene with controlled morphology 
 having high bulk density and containing a very small 
 quantity of fines. This feature allows the use of this catalyst in a process where the catalyst can be fed directly into the 
 polymerization reactor. Particular forms to feed the catalyst are in dry bulk powder, in paste, in oil suspension or in 
 Solvent Suspension. As an alternative the catalyst can be prepolymerized with ethylene or propylene and optionally 
 with a comonomer before being fed into the reactor. 
 0090 Another important feature of the present invention 
 is its tolerance to the high electrostatic charges occurring in gas phase reactors. This feature helps to prevent the forma 
 tion of polymer sheets or agglomerates on the reactor walls. The good catalytic yield and the low decay kinetics observed 
 for the present invention, allows its use in most polymer ization processes, including processes operating in more 
 than one reactor in series. 
 0091. A further feature characteristic of the catalyst of the present invention is when using a microspheroidal silica as 
 Support the catalyst obtained has also a spheroidal morphol ogy and in consequence a polymer product with good 
 morphology and flowability is obtained. 
 0092. The catalyst component of the present invention is advantageously used in the polymerization of ethylene and 
 mixtures thereof with alpha-olefins CH=CHR, wherein R is an alkyl or cycloalkyl or aryl radical with 1-12 carbon 
 atoms because it has a high activity and low decay kinetics. In particular, it is used in the preparation of 
 0093. High density polyethylenes (HDPE, having a den sity greater than 0.940 g/cm), particularly with narrow 
 molecular weight distribution (MFR-27), including homopolymers of ethylene and copolymers of ethylene with 
 one or more alpha-olefins having from 3 to 14 carbon atoms. These products are particularly suitable for thermoforming and injection applications; 
 0094) Linear medium density and linear low density polyethylenes (LMDPE and LLDPE, having a density lower than 0.940 g/cm) most specifically very low and ultra low 
 density linear polyethylenes (VLDPE and ULDPE, having a density lower than 0.920 g/cm and as low as 0.880 g/m) consisting of copolymers of ethylene with one or more US 2006/0166812 A1 
 alpha-olefins having from 3 to 14 carbon atoms, having a 
 content of units derived from ethylene greater than approxi mately 80% by weight. These products have improved 
 properties due to the very good comonomer insertion and, in 
 most cases, they have also a narrow molecular weight 
 distribution (MFR-27). Hence the low xylene soluble con tents are obtained, allowing the production of films with Superior optical properties and very low blocking. The 
 LMDPE products are particularly useful for rotomolding applications; 
 0.095 Elastomeric copolymers of ethylene and propylene 
 and elastomeric terpolymers of ethylene and propylene with 
 minor amounts of a diene, having a content of units derived from ethylene comprised between about 30 and 70% by weight.

 Preparation of the Solid Catalyst Component 
 Example 1 
 0.115. In a 5 liter flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer and previously purged with nitrogen were fed 44 g (0.462 moles) 
 of anhydrous MgCl, and 330 ml (0.969 moles) of Ti(OBu). 
 This mixture was allowed to stir at 300 rpm and heated to 
 150° C. for about 12 hours in order to have the solids 
 completely dissolved, thereby a clear liquid product was 
 obtained. This resulting liquid was cooled down to 40° C. and under gently stirring at 150 rpm, it was diluted with 
 3200 ml of anhydrous hexane. Into this solution kept at 40° C. and under the same stirring, 250 g of the silica Support 
 were added. This silica was previously dehydrated and 
 treated with 19 ml (0.139 moles) of triethylaluminum 
 diluted in anhydrous hexane, for 50 minutes and at room temperature. Once the addition of the silica is completed, the 
 mixture was heated to 60° C. and kept at this temperature for 
 1 hour. Into this mixture, kept at 60° C. and under gently stirring, a solution consisting of 100 ml of anhydrous hexane 
 and 192 ml of PMHS (0.085 moles) was dropped into it over 
 a period of time of 1.5 hours. At the end of the addition, stirring was continued for 2 hours at a temperature of 60° C. 
 To this mixture a solution of 200 ml of anhydrous hexane 
 and 184 ml of SiC1 (1.606 moles) was dropped over a 
 period of time of 1 hour. At the end of the addition, stirring 
 was continued for 3.5 hours at a temperature of 60° C. The temperature of the mixture was then brought to 65° C. and 
 kept for additional 2 hours. After cooling the mixture to room temperature, the stirring was stopped to have the Solid 
 settled. The Supernatant liquid was removed, the Solid was repeatedly washed with anhydrous hexane and then dried at 
 60° C. under nitrogen flow thus giving 390 g of a reddish powder.

 moles) of anhydrous MgCl2 and 39.6 ml (0.116 moles) of 
 Ti(OBu). This mixture was allowed to stir at 300 rpm and 
 heated to 150° C. for about 12 hours in order to have the 
 solids completely dissolved, thereby a clear liquid product 
 was obtained. This resulting liquid was cooled down to 40° C. and under gently stirring at 150 rpm, it was diluted with 
 3200 ml of anhydrous hexane. Into this solution kept at 40° 
 C. and under the same stirring, 300 g of the silica Support were added. This silica was previously dehydrated and 
 treated with 23 ml (0.167 moles) of triethylaluminum 
 diluted in anhydrous hexane, for 50 minutes and at room temperature. Once the addition of the silica is completed, the 
 mixture was heated to 60° C. and kept at this temperature for 
 1 hour. Into this mixture, kept at 60° C. and under gently stirring, a solution consisting of 100 ml of anhydrous hexane 
 and 23 ml of PMHS (0.010 moles) was dropped into it over 
 a period of time of 1.5 hours. At the end of the addition, stirring was continued for 2 hours at a temperature of 60° C. 
 To this mixture a solution of 100 ml of anhydrous hexane 
 and 22 ml of SiCl, (0.192 moles) was dropped over a period 
 of 1 hour. At the end of the addition, stirring was continued for 3.5 hours at a temperature of 60° C. The temperature of 
 the mixture was then brought to 65° C. and kept for

 prepare LLDPE as shown in FIG. 2. 
 0219. A fluidized bed gas phase reactor 1 with 45 cm of 
 internal diameter and 120 cm of reaction Zone height is fed by a dry-solid catalyst feeder 2. The bed of polymer particles 
 in reaction Zone 3 is kept in fluidized state by a recycle 
 stream 4 that works as a fluidizing medium as well as a dissipating heat agent for absorbing the exothermal heat 
 generated within reaction Zone 3. The superficial velocity of 
 the gas, resulting from the flow rate of recycle stream 4 
 within reactor 1 is 0.7 m/s. Stream 5, which contains the gas discharged from reactor 1, said gas having low monomer 
 contents, is fed to the Suction of compressor 6. The com 
 bined reaction and compression heats are then removed from recycle stream 5 in an external heat exchange system 7 in 
 order to control the reactor temperature. The composition of stream 5 is kept constant to yield a polymer with the required specifications. 
 0220 Make-up components are fed to the system at spot 
 8 So as to make up the composition of recycle stream 5. So, 
 make-up stream 8 will include the triethyl aluminum 
 (TEAL) that directly reacts in a ratio of 2 moles of TEAL per mole of catalyst. Also at the spot 8, propane is fed as the 
 selected non-reactive compound required to maintain the total pressure of the system. US 2006/0166812 A1

 0221) The polymerization catalyst is introduced as a dry 
 powder by a catalyst feeder into reactor 1 in a site within the 
 reaction Zone 3, close to the distributing plate 9 in a rate to 
 control the residence time of the catalyst. The reactive gases, 
 including ethylene and comonomers are introduced at the spot 10. 
 0222. The produced polymer is discharged from the reaction Zone through a discharge system 11 that provides 
 the recovery of the reactive and non-reactive gases, recy 
 cling said gases back to the recycle stream 5 at spot 12 and lowers the pressure of the discharged mixture of polymer 
 and gases at certain pressure for later conveying the pro duced polymer particles 13 for downward sampling.

 PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OFA 
 CATALYST AND CATALYST USED IN OLEFN 
 POLYMERZATION 
 The present invention relates to the preparation of a catalyst for the polymerization of ethylene and higher 
 1-olefins. 
 A process for the preparation of a catalyst for use in the polymerization of olefins has been described, in which organic alkali metal compounds are allowed to act on the hydroxyl groups of finely dispersed metal 
 oxides, for example silicon dioxide, and the reaction product is reacted subsequently with a metal halide selected from group VIIa of the Periodic system, espe cially manganese hexachloride (cf. U.S. Pat. No. 3,205,177). The solid obtained gives a catalyst suitable for use in the olefin polymerization when combined with a metallo-organic compound the metal of which is selected from one of groups I to III of the periodic system. These catalysts, however, have a low activity and produce only 1.4 kg of polyethylene per gram of manganese in 3 hours at a polymerization temperature 
 of 95 C. and under an ethylene pressure of 98 atmo spheres. 
 A further process comprises impregnating a solid 
 carrier, for example calcium carbonate, with an alumi num-organic compound and treating it subsequently 
 with an excess of titanium tetrachloride, whereby re 
 duced titanium trichloride forms a sediment on the 
 carrier (cf. British Pat. No. 927,969). Thereafter the excess of titanium tetrachloride must be removed. The 
 polymerization activity of the catalysts thus obtained, 
 however, is likewise so low that the residual catalyst must be removed from the polyolefin produced. Furthermore, there are known catalysts used in the polymerization of olefins, which are obtained by treat ing an oxide, hydroxide, carbonate or sulfate of magne sium or calcium with an aluminum-organic compound and subsequently reacting the compound obtained with 
 a mixture of halides of titanium and vanadium (cf. Ger man Auslegeschrift No. 2,140,326). In the preparation of these catalysts the aluminum-organic compound and 
 the transition metal compound of titanium and vana 10

 dium are used in an amount such that the separation of 45 an excess of these compounds may be dispensed with, but on the other hand, active catalysts for the polyolefin polymerization cannot be obtained when using as transi tion metal compounds solely titanium compounds. A catalyst, for example, which had been prepared by re acting magnesium oxide with aluminum triethyl and by subsequently treating the product obtained with tita nium tetrachloride yielded per hour only 19.5g of poly ethylene per 1 gram of titanium under an ethylene pres sure of 39 atmospheres. A secondary treatment of the polyethylene obtained was necessary for removing the 
 residual catalyst because of the discoloration of poly ethylene. 
 Finally a process for the preparation of supported 
 catalysts has been disclosed, in which an excess of a metallo-organic magnesium or aluminum compound is 
 allowed to act on silicon dioxide, aluminum oxide or a 
 mixture consisting of silicon dioxide and aluminum oxide having superficial hydroxyl groups and the reac 
 tion product is reacted, after the excess of said organo metallic compound has been removed by washing, with an excess of a halogen compound of a transition metal selected from one of groups IVa, Va or VIa of the 50 
 55 
 65 2 
 periodical system, and the excess of the transition metal compound is removed by washing with a solvent. By washing out the metallo-organic compounds of magne 
 sium or aluminum and the transition metals there are formed highly diluted solutions, which must be decom posed subsequently. As a consquence thereof, undesired 
 waste products are obtained, which are contained in the waste water (cf. German Offenlegungsschrift No. 
 2,109,273). It has now been found that a catalyst suitable for use in the polymerization of 1-olefins can be obtained by starting from the reaction product of silicon dioxide and/or a metal oxide with a Grignard compound as a carrier and a soluble titanium compound, which cata lyst gives high yields and allows a good control of the molecular weight by means of hydrogen without mak ing a separation of the excess of metallo-organic com pounds and/or of titanium compounds from the carrier 
 necessary. The present invention consequently provides a pro cess for the preparation of a catalyst by reacting the reaction product of silicon dioxide and/or aluminum oxide and 1. a halogen-containing magnesium-organic compound and 2. a halogen compound of a transition metal (component A) with a metallo-organic compound (component B), which comprises reacting a silicon di oxide and/or aluminum oxide having a hydroxyl con tent of from 0.5 to 50 mmols/g first with a magnesium compound of the formula RMgX, in which R is a hy droxarbon radical having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms and X is chlorine, bromine or iodine, in the presence of a diluent, in an amount of from 0.05 to 1 mol of magne sium compound per mol of hydroxyl groups of the carrier and reacting thereafter the solid reaction prod uct in suspension with a halogen-containing titanium (IV) compound of the formula TiX(OR))4-, in which n is an integer of from 1 to 4, X is chlorine or bromine and R is a hydrocarbon radical having of from 1 to 12 
 carbon atoms, in an amount of from 0.01 to 1 mol of titanium compound per mol of hydroxyl groups of the carrier, to obtain the component A. Suitable carriers are porous oxides or mixed oxides of silicon and/or aluminum having a specific surface of from 50 to 1000 m2/g, preferably from 100 to 800, espe cially from 150 to 650 and a pore volume in the range of from 0.2 to 2 ml/g, preferably of from 0.4 to 2, espe cially of from 0.6 to 1.7 ml/g. The particle size is in the range of from 1 to 500 am, preferably from 10 to 200 um, especially of from 20 to 100 um. The number of hydroxyl groups depends on the specific surface and the temperature of the preliminary treatment and is in the range of from 0.5 to 50 mmols preferably of from 1 to 20 mmols, especially of from 1.5 to 10 mmols, hydroxyl groups per gram of carrier. Several of these oxides are prepared especially for being used as a carrier of sup ported catalysts. They are commercial products. Prior to the reaction of the hydroxyl groups of the carrier with the halogen-containing magnesium-organic compounds the absorbed water must be removed by drying at a temperature of from 120 to 800° C., prefera bly of from 200 to 500 C. The number of hydroxyl groups (mmol of hydroxyl groups per gram of carrier) may be modified by said treatment at high temperature, whereby it is reduced with an increasing temperature. After drying the carrier is kept under an inert gas atmosphere, for example nitrogen or argon, with the 
 exclusion of air or water. 4,148,754 3 Suitable halogen-containing magnesium-organic compounds are compounds of the formula RMgX, in which R is a hydrocarbon radical having from 1 to 20, preferably from 2 to 10 carbon atoms and X is chlorine, bromine or iodine. These compounds are known as Grignard compounds and may be prepared, for example by reaction of metallic magnesium with a halogenhy drocarbon having from 1 to 20, preferably from 2 to 10 carbon atoms, for example an alkyl, -cycloalkyl-or aryl halide, in the presence of a nucleophilic solvent, for example an ether (cf. Organikum, VEB Deutscher Ver lag der Wissenschaften, Berlin, 1964, page 466). These compounds may also be prepared in a hydrocarbon in 
 the absence of an ether. Preferred magnesium com pounds are ethyl magnesium chloride, n-propyl magne sium chloride, i-propyl magnesium iodide, n-butyl mag nesium chloride, t-butyl magnesium chloride, phenyl and magnesium bromide. n-Propyl magnesium chloride and n-butyl magnesium chloride are particularly prefer 
 able. The Grignard compound reacts in known manner with the hydroxyl groups placed at the surface of the carrier at a temperature below 100° C. while splitting off hydrocarbon, with the addition of -Mgx to the oxygen of the hydroxyl group according to the follow ing equation: 
 - - 
 -o-it-oh -- RMgX -o-i-o-Mex -- R-H 
 -O -O 
 Consequently one mol of magnesium alkyl chloride is chemically bound per mole of hydroxyl groups of the carrier. The number of hydroxyl groups of the carrier may, consequently, be determined by volumetric or chromatographic analysis of the hydrocarbon formed or by retitration of the excess of Grignard compound. The reaction of the solid carrier with the Grignard compound may be carried out in the following way: The solid carrier is suspended in an inert diluent, the dissolved Grignard compound is added at a tempera ture of from -20° to 150° C., preferably of from 0 to 120° C., especially of from 20' to 100° C., and allowed to act on the suspension for a period of from 0.5 to 20, preferably from 0.5 to 10, especially from 0.5 to 2, hours. The proportion of Grignard compound and solid carrier is chosen such that from 0.05 to 1, preferably from 0.1 to 0.95, mol of alkyl magnesium halide is used per mole of hydroxyl groups of the carrier. The magne sium compound is applied on the carrier quantitatively in said process. The reaction is completed when no more magnesium can be detected in the supernatant 
 solution after the solid carrier has settled. 
 Suitable diluents are all solvents inert with regard to Grignard compounds, for example saturated hydrocar bons or ethers, for example pentane, hexane, heptane, diethyl ether, tetrahydrofurane, or mixture of both types of compounds. After completion of the above reaction the diluent is separated by filtration and drying or directly by distilla tion, at a temperature of from 50 to 200 C., if it con tains an ether. The separation of the diluent is necessary for removing the ether, which has been used for the preparation of the Grignard compound and formed a complex with said compound, owing to the fact that the ether also reacts with the titanium compound while forming a complex and deactivates the catalyst.

 The separated diluent may be reused after having 
 been recovered. The solid carrier impregnated with the Grignard compound is thereafter suspended again in an inert dispersing agent, preferably in an inert hydrocarbon. A dispersing agent conventionally used for the polymeri zation under low pressure according to Ziegler is 
 chosen preferably. When not an ether but a saturated hydrocarbon is used for the preparation of the Grignard compound, the 
 diluent need not be separated and the titanium(IV) com pound may be directly added to the reaction mixture. Suitable inert dispersing agents are aliphatic or cycloali phatic hydrocarbons, for example pentane, hexane, heptane, cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane as well as 
 aromatic hydrocarbons, for example benzene, toluene, 
 xylene, and furthermore benzine or Diesel oil fractions, which have been carefully purified of oxygen, sulfur compounds and moisture, may be used. To the suspension obtained there is added subse quently a halogen-containing titanium(IV) compound, at a temperature of from 20 to 140 C., preferably of from 30 to 130 C, especially of from 40 to 120° C. and the mixture is stirred at this temperature until a titanium compound can no longer be detected in the suernatant solution, generally within a period of from 2 to 20 
 hours. The halogen-containing titanium(IV) compound is a compound of the formula TiXn (OR)4-, wherein n is an integer of from 1 to 4 and X is chlorine or bromine and R is a hydrocarbon radical, preferably an alkyl, aryl or aralkyl radical having from 1 to 12, preferably from 1 to 8 carbon atoms, especially a straight chain or branched alkyl radical having from 1 to 8 carbon atoms, for example TiCl4, TiCl3, (O-n-C3H7), TiCl2(O-n- C3H7)2, TiCl(O-n-C3H7)3, TiCl2(O-1-C3H)2, TiCl3(O-i- C3H7), TiCl3(O-CH2C6H5), TiCl2(O-CH2C6H5)2, TiCl 3(O-i-C4H9) and TiCl2(O-i-C4H9)2. Titanium tetrachloride, TiCl2(O-i-C3H)2 and TiCl 3(O-i-C3H7) are used preferably. The proportion between the titanium compound and 
 the solid carrier is chosen such that of from 0.01 to 1, preferably of from 0.05 to 1, especially of from 0.1 to 1, mol of titanium compound is used per 1 mole of hy droxyl groups of the solid carrier. The proportion of, Grignard compound to the tita 
 nium compound is chosen such that the atomic ratio of magnesium to titanium in the catalyst component A is in the range of from 0.01 to 10, preferably of from 0.05 to 5, especially of from 0.1 to 2. The catalyst component A thus obtained is used ei ther directly in the form of the suspension or after re 
 moval of the diluent and drying. Suitable compounds for the component B are organic 
 compounds of the metals selected from one of the main groups I, II and III of the periodic system. Aluminum organic compounds are preferably used as component 
 B. Suitable aluminum-organic compounds are the reac tion products of aluminum-trialkyls or aluminum dial kyl hydrides, containing alkyl radicals having from 1 to 
 16 carbon atoms, with dienes having from 4 to 20 car bon atoms. The reaction products of aluminum trialkyls or aluminum-dialkyl hydrides, the alkyl radicals of 
 which have from 4 to 8 carbon atoms, for example phellandrene of a diene of the formula 4,148,754 
 wherein R2 and R2 is hydrogen, an alkyl radical, an alkylene radical having a non-terminal double bond or a mononuclear aryl radical and a is 0 or 1, are used prefer ably. There may be mentioned, by way of example, 1,4-butadiene, isoprene, 2-phenyl butadiene, 1,4-pen tadiene, 1,3-pentadiene and myrcene. The reaction products of Al(i-C4H9)3 or Al(i-C4H9)2H with isoprene are used preferably. They comprise, for example, com pounds of the formula 
 R3 
 Z-A-R-Y-Z 
 wherein Y means the groups 
 R3 R4 R4 
 -Al-, - Al- crA 1-, o / N A. N / R4 
 Z is hydrogen, the isobutyl group, the dihydroisoprenyl group or an oligomer of this group, R is the isobutyl radical, R4 is the tetrahydroisoprenylene radical and n is an integer of from d1 to 20, the compounds of the for 
 mula 
 Al-R-Y-R 
 wherein Y, R3 and Rand n are defined as above. The ratio between C5 and C4 radicals in the reaction prod ucts of A1(i-C4H9)3 or A1(i-C4H9)2H with isoprene may generally be in the range of from 0.25 to 10, preferably 1 to 4. A compound of this type being commercially available under the name ""aluminum isoprenyl' is used particularly preferable. Further suitable compounds for component B are chlorine-containing aluminum-organic compounds, for example dialkyl aluminum monochlorides of the for mula R52AlCl or alkyl aluminum sesqui-chlorides of the formula R53Al2Cl3, wherein R5 is a hydrocarbon radical having from 1 to 16 carbon atoms, preferably an alkyl radical having from 1 to 16, especially from 2 to 12 carbon atoms. There may be mentioned, by way of example (C2H5)2AlCl, (i-C4H9)2AlCl, (C2H5)3Al2Cl3. Especially suitable compounds for the component B are aluminum trialkyls of the formula AllR3 or alumi num dialkyl hydrides of the formula AllR2H, wherein R5 is a hydrocarbon radical having from 1 to 16 carbon atoms, preferably an alkyl radical having from 1 to 16, especially from 2 to 4 carbon atoms, for example Al(C2H5)3, Al(C2H5)2H Al(C3H7)2H, Al(i-C4H9)3, Al(i- C4H9)2H. The conversion of the titanium(IV) compound of component A into the polymerization active compound having a lower valency is advantageously performed during the polymerization by the metallo-organic com pound (component B) at a temperature of from 20' to 150° C., preferably of from 60' to 140 C. Component A may also be treated with a metallo organic compound prior to polymerizing and be used subsequently in the polymerization at a temperature of 10

 from -30 to 150° C., preferably of from 0 to 100° C., with a molar ratio between metallo-organic compound and titanium compound of from 0.2:1 to 3:1, preferably from 0.5:1 to 2:1. If a chlorine-containing metallo organic compound is used it is advisable to wash the reaction product obtained with fresh dispersing agent. Thereafter it is activated with a further metallo-organic compound at a temperature of from 20 to 150 C. When using the catalyst according to the invention at least one 1-olefin of the formula R6-CH=CH2, wherein R6 is hydrogen or a straight chain or branched alkyl radical having from 1 to 10, preferably from 1 to 8, carbon atoms, is polymerized. Examples of such olefins are ethylene, propylene, butene-1, hexene-1, 4-methyl-pentene-1, octene-1. Ethylene is preferably 
 polymerized alone or as a mixture consisting of at least 70% by weight of ethylene and at most 30% by weight 
 of a further 1-olefin of the above formula. Ethylene is especially polymerized either alone or as a mixture of at least 92% by weight of ethylene and at most 8% by 
 weight of a further 1-olefin of the above formula. The molecular weight of the polymer is controlled in known manner, preferably by using hydrogen. The polymerization may be carried out in solution, in suspension or in the gaseous phase, continuously or 
 discontinuously, at a temperature of from 20 to 150 C., 
 preferably of from 60 to 140 C., under a pressure of from 0.5 to 50 bars. It is carried out preferably under the technically interesting pressure in the range of from 1 to 
 40 bars. 
 Thereby the titanium compound is used in a concen 
 tration of from 0.005 to 1.5, preferably of from 0.05 to 1, mmol per liter of dispersing agent or reactor volume. The metallo-organic compound is used in a concentra 
 tion of from 0.5 to 10 mmols, preferably of from 2 to 6 mmols, per liter of dispersing agent or reactor volume. Higher concentrations are also possible principally. The polymerization in suspension or solution is car 
 ried out in a conventional inert solvent for low pressure processes according to Ziegler, which have been de 
 scribed above. 
 The process according to the invention has the ad vantage that excessive metal compounds do not have to be removed from the catalyst component A by washing, owing to the fact that both the halogen-containing mag nesium-organic compound used and the halogen-con taining titanium(IV) compound react completely with the carrier. Consequently, no washing liquids are formed from which the metal compounds must be sepa rated prior to the secondary treatment. As a conse quence thereof there are formed no metal-containing waste water or slurries. During the polymerization of ethylene and higher 1-olefins the catalyst according to the invention gives high catalyst yields under low pres 
 sure, for example of from 1 to 7 bars, such that the magnesium/titanium and aluminum compound may 
 completely remain in the polymer; a discoloration of the polyolefin or corrosion phenomena on the processing machines do not occur. Thus expensive operations such as a decomposition of the catalyst and a removal of the catalyst may be dispensed with. Carrying out the poly merization under a higher pressure permits use of a still smaller quantity of catalyst, as the catalyst yield is highly improved with an increasing polymerization 
 pressure. The catalyst according to the invention is especially suitable for the polymerization of ethylene in the gase 4,148,754 7 
 ous phase in a fluidized bed. The use of oxide carriers having a particle size of more than 30 Jum, which may be obtained for example by separating fine particles by sieving, prevents finely divided catalysts or polymer 
 parts from being carried out of the fluidized bed and forming deposits in exterior zones of the reactor. The catalyst according to the invention permits prep aration of a polymer, the powder in bulk of which has a high air permeability and thus may directly be used in the processing by injection molding or extrusion with out previous granulation. A good air permeability of the powder in bulk in the extruder feeding zone prevents an incorporation of air into the molten polymer, which 
 would cause a formation of bubbles in the finished part. The porous silicon dioxide having one or more sur face OH groups is designated as ""silicic acid' in the examples. For determining the number of hydroxyl groups of 
 the carrier 10.0 g of the dried silicic acid are reacted under an argon atmosphere while refluxing and stirring with a solution of 500 mmols of n-propyl magnesium chloride in 500 ml of diethyl ether, for a period of 4 hours. After settling of the silicic acid magnesium is retitrated in the supernatant solution by way of com plexometry. The titanium content of component A is determined colorimetrically by using hydrogen peroxide (cf. G. O. 
 Muller, Praktikum der quantitativen chemischen Ana lyse, 4th edition, (1957), page 243). For the polymerization in suspension there is used a hydrated Diesel oil fraction having a boiling range of 
 from 140 to 200 C. 
 The melt index of the polymer is determined accord ing to DIN (German Industrial Standard) 53,735, at 190° C., by using a load of 5 kg for is and of 15 kg for i15. The reduced specific viscosity (RSV) is determined with a solution of decahydronaphthalene at 135 C. at a 
 concentration of 1 g/b 1. The bulk density is determined by weighing 100 cm of polyethylene powder. The air permeability is determined in the following manner: 100 cm3 of polyethylene powder are placed in a graduated cylinder, which has an inner diameter of 3 cm and a fritted glass bottom, and air suctioned through the powder at a rate of flow of 4 l/h; the pressure de crease occuring in the powder in bulk is determined. The air permeability is then determined in the following 
 nanner: 
 height of the package X flow velocity air permeability (L) = diameter of the cylinder X pressure loss. 
 In the present invention L is 0.023/A p - 1, whereby A p is millimeters of the water column and 1 mm water column corresponds to the pressure loss of the glass frit. The diamension of L is (cm . . sec/g). All solvents are distilled under an inert gas atmo sphere having a purity of at least 99.995% in a circula tion apparatus while passing over benzophenone potas sium and are withdrawn under an inert gas atmosphere. The preparation of the catalyst and the polymerization of ethylene are carried out under an argon atmosphere or under an atmosphere of purified nitrogen while care fully excluding air and humidity. The following examples illustrate the invention.

 particle size of 70 um is dried for 6 hours in a fluidized bed at 460 C. under an argon atmosphere and kept under an argon atmosphere. The number of hydroxyl groups is 1.7 mmols of hydroxy groups per 1 g of silicic 
 acid. 
 107 g of this silicic acid are suspended in 500 ml of nheptane under an argon atmosphere, 343 ml of a solu tion of 172 mmols of n-propyl magnesium chloride (1.6 mnols of magnesium per 1 g of silicic acid) in diethyl 
 ether are added and the mixture is heated for 4 hours to 
 50° C. The solvent is withdrawn thereafter in a rotary evaporator and the solid product is dried for 2 hours at 120° C. under 0.5 torr. Thereafter the solid product is suspended in 500 ml of n-heptane under an argon atmo 
 sphere, 20.3 g of titanium tetrachloride (1.0 mmol of titanium per 1 g of silicic acid) are added and the mix ture is stirred for 7 hours at 90° C. Heptane is thereafter withdrawn at 120° C. in the rotary evaporator under atmospheric pressure. 128 g of a flowable powder is 
 obtained. 
 The titanium analysis reveals 39.8 mg of titanium per 1 g of the component A. The atomic ratio of magnesi 
 um/titanium is 1.6:1. 
 500 ml of Diesel oil are introduced into a 1 liter auto 
 clave provided with a flat blade agitator, the air is dis placed by evacuating and introducing nitrogen under 
 pressure three times and the autoclave is heated to 85 C. 1.14 g of aluminum triethyl and 0.12 g of the catalyst component A are added. Hydrogen is then introduced until a pressure of 2 bars is attained and ethylene is 
 introduced in an amount sufficient to maintain a total 
 pressure of 5.9 bars. After 2 hours of polymerization at 85 C. the polyethylene powder is separated from the 
 dispersing agent by filtration and dried for 15 hours at 95° C. in vacuo. 115 g of polyethylene are obtained having an is value of 9.3 and a bulk density of 330g/1. The yield of polyethylene was 24,000 g per 1 g of titanium or 958g per 1 g of the catalyst component A. 
 EXAMPLE 2 
 Ethylene is polymerized in the presence of 0.22 g of the catalyst component A described in Example 1 under the same conditions as in Example 1, but by using in stead of aluminum triethyl 1.98 g of aluminum triisobu tyl. After 2 hours there are obtained 145g of polyethyl ene having a melt index is of 7.9 and a bulk density of 350 g/1. The RSV value is 1.84 g dl/g. There are ob tained per 1 gram of titanium 16,600 g of polyethylene and per gram of the catalyst component A, 659g. 
 EXAMPLE 3 
 Polymerization of ethylene in the gaseous phase. 2 kg of polyethylene (is = 10.8, bulk density 410 g/l) are introduced into a lying 80 liter reactor provided with a scraping stirrer. The reactor is liberated from air by evacuating several times and by flushing for several hours with an ethylene-hydrogen mixture and is heated thereafter to 90° C. 17.1 g of aluminum triethyl and 2.41 g of the catalyst component A prepared according to Example 1 are added. 2 kg of ethylene/hour and hydro 
 gen are introduced for a period of 6 hours until the hydrogen portion is 20% by volume. The polymeriza tion temperature is 95 C. The pressure mounts to 10.7 
 bars in the course of the reaction. There are obtained 14 
 kg of polyethylene having a melt index is of 0.95 and a bulk density of 435 g/l. A sieve analysis reveals a fine portion of 0.2% by weight below 100 pum and 0% by 4,148,754 
 weight below 50 m. 125,000 g of polyethylene per gram of titanium and 5,809 g of polyethylene per gram of the catalyst component A are obtained. 
 COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE A 
 The example demonstrates that the catalytic activity is not improved when using an excess of titanium tetra chloride under the conditions indicated in Example 1, while washing several times the excess of titanium com ponent. 
 10.0 g of the silicic acid treated previously with the Grignard compound according to Example 1 are sus pended in 50 ml of n-heptane per gram of silicic acid) for a period of 6 hoursat 90° C. while stirring under an argon atmosphere. The insoluble solid matter is washed eight times by decanting and stirring with each 80 ml of n-heptane until 10 ml of the supernatant solution con tains less than 0.001 mmol of titanium compound. Hep tane is then withdrawn in the rotary evaporator at 120 C. There are obtained 9.7 g of a flowable powder, which contains 40.1 mg of titanium per gram. Ethylene is polymerized with Ol. 12 g of the powder 
 obtained under the same conditions as in Example 1. There are obtained 80 g of polyethylene having a melt index is of 5.7 and a bulk density of 295 g/l. There are obtained 16,600 g of polyethylene per gram of titanium and 666 g per gram of the catalyst component A. 
 COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE B 
 The example demonstrates that the activity of the catalyst is not improved when using an excess of the Grignard and titanium compound during the catalyst preparation and when removing the excess of magne sium and titanium compounds by washing several times. 6.6 g of the dried silicic acid according to Example 1 are suspended in 25 ml of n-heptane, 66 ml of a solution of 33 mmols of n-propyl magnesium chloride (5 mmols per 1 gram of silicic acid) in diethyl ether are added and the mixture is refluxed for 4 hours. The insoluble solid 
 matter is washed three times, each with 80 ml of diethyl ether, and two times, each with 80 ml of n-heptane, by decanting and stirring until no more magnesium can be 
 detected in the separated solution. The solvent is then removed in the rotary evaporator under 1 torr at 150

 PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF 
 POLYETHYLENE 
 TECHNICAL FIELD 
 This invention relates to a proceSS for the preparation of 
 polyethylene with a focus on catalyst activation. 
 BACKGROUND INFORMATION 
 Polyethylene has long been prepared with Ziegler-Natta 
 catalyst Systems, which typically include a catalyst precur 
 Sor made up of transition metal(s) and an electron donor, and a cocatalyst. In order to obtain the high level of catalyst activity essential to commercial polymerization processes, it 
 is necessary to provide for essentially complete activation of 
 the precursor. It should be noted, however, that catalyst 
 activity in these Systems is also affected by a number of 
 other variables including the method of catalyst manufacture 
 or formation, the use of internal electron donors, the chemi 
 cal composition of the internal electron donor, and the total 
 amount of internal electron donor. 
 Once the basic catalyst is formed, it is necessary to 
 remove internal electron donor from the vicinity of the active site and (if necessary) chlorinate and/or reduce the 
 valence site of the active metal. Electron donor (ED) is complexed or reacted away from the active Site by either activator compound (defined as an Al compound which is capable of reducing TiCl, to Ti"" valency; such compounds 
 can be generically described as RAIX, wherein X is a halogen, typically Cl; n ranges from 1 to 3 with preferred 
 values ranging from 1.5 to 3; and R is preferably CH, CH5, 
 iCHo, nC. Ho, nCH, or nGHz) or by a Lewis acid (typically RMX, wherein n+m=the valency of M; R is an alkyl or alkoxy or aryloxy group; X is a halogen; and M=B, 
 Al, or Si). The formula of a non-activator Lewis Acid can be RBX, wherein X=0 to 2. It is desirable to supply sufficient 
 activator or Lewis acid to remove at least 90 percent and preferably close to 100 percent of the ED compound from 
 the active site. Due to chemical equilibria, it may be nec essary to add a greater than Stoichiometric amount of 
 activator compound to electron donor to fully activate the catalyst. Activation can be accomplished by partial activa 
 tion before introduction of the precursor into the reactor and 
 completion of the activation in the reactor by means of the cocatalyst, or full activation prior to introduction of the 
 precursor into the reactor. 
 The disadvantages of partial activation lie in the require ment for additional proceSS StepS and equipment to provide 
 the partially activated precursor followed by final activation 
 in the reactor, which requires excessive amounts of activator compound, i.e., cocatalyst (typically, aluminum alkyl 
 compounds), to be added to the reactor So that an adequate 
 concentration of activator compound is present at the active 
 polymerization site. AS noted above, the function of this activator compound is to extract electron donor compound 
 from the potential active site and to activate the active site either by alkylation (if the active site is already at the correct Valence State) or by reduction and alkylation if the active site valence state requires reduction, for example, from Ti"" to Ti"". In addition to being wasteful, this excess activator compound can cause operational problems or detriment to 
 the final product. 
 Typical preactivated catalysts are described in U.S. Pat. 
 Nos. 4,482,687; 4,508,842; and 5,290,745. Preactivated catalysts of the prior art can be formulated with sufficient activator compound to fully activate the precursor compo 15

 Sition; however, putting large amounts of activator com pound directly onto these catalysts can also result in 
 deactivation, catalysts which are hazardous to handle due to pyrophoricity, or catalysts which have poor flow properties. 
 Some of these disadvantages can be addressed by dispersing the catalyst in a carrier Such as an inert hydrocarbon; however, the disadvantage of needing multiple operations to produce the catalyst and the inability to adjust the final 
 catalyst composition to account for variations in monomer 
 quality are Serious limitations for commercial operation. A 
 further limitation for commercial operation is the need to dilute the catalyst sufficiently with the inert hydrocarbon to 
 prevent deactivation of the catalyst due to high concentra tion of activator compound in the catalyst Slurry. 
 The use of excess amounts of cocatalyst in Ziegler-Natta catalyzed polymerizations is Standard practice in the art. 
 Typical Al/Ti molar ratios used in prior art processes are 
 usually greater than 20:1, and many are in the 50:1 to 100:1 range. In the description of these processes, lower values are 
 mentioned, but clearly are not preferred. In other prior art, 
 very low levels of added aluminum alkyl ranging from 0.1:1 to about 10:1 are Suggested, but the catalyst Systems 
 involved here are devoid of electron donor type compounds, 
 and So are not relevant to the processes under discussion in this specification. A typical non-ED System is described in 
 U.S. Pat. No. 5,077,358. 
 Prepolymerization Systems are also mentioned in the prior 
 art. Typical examples of this kind of catalyst System are 
 mentioned in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,077,358 and 4,990,479. These 
 Systems also do not use internal electron donors, and addi tion of extra aluminum alkyl activator component can lead to catalyst productivity increases to Such an extent that 
 Severe operational instabilities are observed. These catalysts are typically activated in the prepolymer preparation with 
 low amounts of an aluminum alkyl activator compound and 
 frequently with the use of an external electron donor. While “free” aluminum alkyl may be removed from the prepoly 
 mer prior to use in the main polymerization reactor, the prepolymer catalysts are fully activated in the reactor with 
 large exceSS amounts of cocatalyst. 
 European Patent Application 783 007 discloses a process for production of polyethylene using reduced amounts of 
 aluminum alkyl feed; however, this disclosure focuses exclusively on the use of external addition of additional activator compound, i.e., Separate activator and catalyst 
 feeds, and overall Al/Timolar ratios, which are at the lower 
 end of the higher ratios recited above for electron donor bearing catalysts. Operating in this mode introduces other Specific problems, Such as the need for exceptionally precise 
 control of cocatalyst feed rates to avoid reaction runaway and agglomerate formation. A further disadvantage of 
 “starved” activator feed is that the hydrogen response of the catalyst, i.e. the relative hydrogen:ethylene mole ratio 
 required to achieve a given molecular weight at otherwise 
 constant reaction conditions, is dramatically effected requir ing larger amounts of hydrogen to achieve the same given 
 molecular weight or melt index. 
 Although good polymerization activity is achievable by 
 adding external activator compound, the fact that catalyst 
 and activator compound are added Separately requires exces 
 Sive amounts of activator compound to keep the required 
 amount of activator compound at the desired level at the active polymerization site. ExceSS activator compound also 
 can cause formation of oils, can over-activate Some Sites 
 thus forming highly branched materials which are 
 undesirable, and can, in the extreme, actually cause catalyst activity decreases. US 6,617.405 B1

 DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION 
 An object of this invention, therefore, is to provide a proceSS for preparing polyethylene, which overcomes the 
 deficiencies associated with Separate and/or excessive addi tion of cocatalyst aluminum alkyl. Other objects and advan 
 tages will become apparent hereinafter. 
 According to the present invention, Such a process has been discovered. The process entails contacting ethylene per 
 Se or ethylene and one or more comonomers in one or more fluidized bed reactors, under polymerization conditions, with a catalyst System comprising (i) a Supported or unsup ported magnesium/titanium based precursor in Slurry form, 
 said precursor containing an electron donor; and (ii) an 
 activator in an amount Sufficient to complete the activation of the precursor. The invention lies in an improvement to this process comprising 
 (A) mixing the precursor and the activator prior to intro 
 duction into the reactor in two or three Steps, the last Step being a topping-off Step in which activation is completed; 
 (B) maintaining the mixture from Step (A) in Slurry form; 
 and 
 (C) introducing the mixture from Step (B) into the reactor with the following provisos: 
 (I) the atomic ratio of aluminum to titanium is in the range of about 1:1 to about 15:1 and the mole ratio 
 of activator to electron donor is about 1:1 to about 
 2:1; (II) the activator is one compound or a sequential 
 mixture of two different compounds, (III) each activator compound has the formula Al(R) Xs wherein each R is independently a saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon radical having 1 to 14 carbon 
 atoms, each X is independently chlorine, bromine, or 
 iodine, and n is 1 to 3, (IV) the activation of the precursor is essentially com pleted prior to the introduction of the precursor into 
 the reactor; and 
 (V) no additional activator is introduced into the reactor (S). 
 DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED 
 EMBODIMENT(S) 
 The gaseous materials used in the process can be intro 
 duced into the reactors via a recycle gas. The recycle gas is defined as a mixture of gases including ethylene per Se or ethylene and one or more alpha-olefins, preferably one or 
 two alpha-olefins, as comonomers and, optionally, one or more inert gases Such as nitrogen (to make up the desired reactor pressure), inert hydrocarbons, and hydrogen. The alpha-olefins can be, for example, propylene, 1-butene, 
 1-hexene, 4-methyl-1-pentene, and 1-octene. The alpha 
 olefins usually have no more than 12 carbon atoms, and preferably, 3 to 8 carbon atoms. The recycle gas can also be 
 referred to as the inlet gas or cycle gas. 
 The catalyst system can be exemplified by one where the 
 precursor is formed by Spray drying and used in Slurry form. 
 Such a catalyst precursor, for example, contains titanium, 
 magnesium, and an electron donor, and, optionally, an 
 aluminum halide. The precursor is introduced into a hydro 
 carbon medium Such as mineral oil to provide a slurry. This 
 spray dried catalyst is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,290,745. 
 Other processes are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,601,742 and 4,482,687. In whichever manner the catalyst precursor is produced, the precursor is preferably Suspended in an 15

 65 4 
 inert, high Viscosity fluid, e.g., a moderately high Viscosity 
 mineral oil, to allow efficient blending of the activator compound. 
 A typical magnesium/titanium based catalyst System can 
 be described as follows: 
 The precursor can have the formula MgTiOR).X(ED), wherein R is an aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon radical 
 having 1 to 14 carbon atoms or COR' wherein R' is an aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon radical having 1 to 14 
 carbon atoms; each OR group is the same or different; X is independently chlorine, bromine or iodine, ED is an electron 
 donor; d is 0.5 to 56; e is 0, 1, or 2; f is 2 to 116; and g is 1.5d+2. It is prepared from a titanium compound, a magne 
 Sium compound, and an electron donor. Titanium compounds, which are useful in preparing these precursors, 
 have the formula Ti(OR), X, wherein R, X, and e are as defined above, h is an integer from 1 to 4, and e--h is 3 or 4. Some specific examples of titanium compounds are TiCl, 
 TiCl, Ti(OCH) Br; Ti(OCH)Cl; and Ti(OCOCH) Cls. TiCl and TiCl, are preferred compounds. The magne sium compounds include magnesium halides Such as MgCl, MgBr, and Mg2. Anhydrous MgCl2 is a preferred com 
 pound. About 0.5 to about 56, and preferably about 1 to about 10, moles of the magnesium compounds are used per 
 mole of titanium compound. 
 The electron donor is an organic Lewis base, liquid at temperatures in the range of about 0 degrees C. to about 200 
 degrees C., in which the magnesium and titanium com 
 pounds are Soluble. The electron donor can be an alkyl ester of an aliphatic or aromatic carboxylic acid, an aliphatic 
 ketone, an aliphatic amine, an aliphatic alcohol, an alkyl or 
 cycloalkyl ether, or mixtures thereof, each electron donor 
 having 2 to 20 carbon atoms. Among these electron donors, the preferred are alkyl and cycloalkyl ethers having 2 to 20 
 carbon atoms, dialkyl, diaryl, and alkylaryl ketones having 
 3 to 20 carbon atoms, and alkyl, alkoxy, and alkylalkoxy esters of alkyl and aryl carboxylic acids having 2 to 20 
 carbon atoms. The most preferred electron donor is tetrahy 
 drofuran. Other examples of Suitable electron donors are methyl formate, ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, ethyl ether, 
 dioxane, di-n-propyl ether, dibutyl ether, ethanol, 1-butanol, ethyl formate, methyl acetate, ethyl anisate, ethylene 
 carbonate, tetrahydropyran, and ethyl propionate. Alcohol 
 containing electron donors which react with the transition metal halide compounds are not preferred. 
 While an excess of electron donor is used initially to provide the reaction product of titanium compound and 
 electron donor, the reaction product finally contains about 1 
 to about 20 moles of electron donor per mole of titanium compound and preferably about 1 to about 10 moles of 
 electron donor per mole of titanium compound. 
 The activators that can be used in the invention are 
 compounds of the formula RAIX. Compounds of the 
 formula RBX, (where n is 0 to 2) are typical Lewis acids, which are not activator compounds, but are useful in the 
 instant invention. The activator/Lewis acid compounds are added preferably in the same inert diluent as the catalyst precursor. The precursor activator used in the pre-activation 
 can be one compound or a mixture of two different com pounds. Each compound can have the formula (R)AIX, wherein each R is independently a Saturated aliphatic hydro 
 carbon radical having 1 to 14 carbon atoms; each X is a halogen, preferably independently chlorine, bromine, or 
 iodine, and n is 1 to 3. Examples of the R radical are methyl, ethyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, n-hexyl and n-octyl. Preferred acti 
 vators include diethyl aluminum chloride, triethyl US 6,617.405 B1 
 S 
 aluminum, tri-n-hexyl aluminum, dimethyl aluminum chloride, and tri-n-octyl aluminum. Particularly preferred 
 activators are: a Sequential mixture of tri-n-hexylaluminum 
 and diethylaluminum chloride; a Sequential mixture of tri ethylaluminum and diethylaluminum chloride; a Sequential 
 mixture of diethylaluminum chloride and tri-n- heXylaluminum; a Sequential mixture of diethylaluminum 
 chloride and triethylaluminum; and either diethyl aluminum 
 chloride or tri-n-hexyl aluminum. 
 In the Sequential mixture, it is preferred to have the first 
 precursor activator (Activator 1) of the formula AlR and the Second precursor activator (Activator 2) of formula Al(R) 
 Xs, wherein R, X, and n are the same as above. Preferred mole ratioS of Activator 2 to Activator 1 range from about 
 1:1 to about 6:1. 
 The activators can also be represented by the formulas RA1 or RAIX wherein each R is independently alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, or hydrogen; at least one R is hydrocarbyl, 
 and two or three R radicals can be joined to form a heterocyclic structure. Each R, which is a hydrocarbyl 
 radical, can have 1 to 20 carbon atoms, and preferably has 1 to 10 carbon atoms. X is a halogen, preferably chlorine, 
 bromine, or iodine. 
 Examples of hydrocarbyl aluminum activators, in addi 
 tion to those mentioned above, are as follows: tri isobutylaluminum, di-isobutyl-aluminum hydride, dihexyla 
 luminum hydride, di-isobutyl-hexylaluminum, isobutyl diheXylaluminum, trimethylaluminum, tripropylaluminum, 
 trii Sopropylaluminum, tri-n-butyl aluminum, tridecylaluminum, tridodecylaluminum, tribenzylaluminum, 
 trip he nylaluminum, trinaphthylaluminum, tritolylaluminum, isoprenylaluminum, dibutylaluminum 
 chloride, diisobutylaluminum chloride, and ethylaluminum SeSquichloride. 
 Essentially complete activation of the precursor is carried 
 out prior to the introduction of the precursor into the reactor. Depending on Specific chemical equilibria, the total amount 
 of activator can range from about 1 mole of activator per 
 mole of electron donor to about 2 moles of activator per mole of electron donor. This ratio also applies to each 
 activator when two activators are used, but the total amount 
 of activator(s) will not be in excess of this ratio. It will be 
 understood that after this activation, no additional activators 
 are added to the reactor(s). 
 In a preferred mode (Sometimes referred to as an in-line reduction System), the precursor is introduced into a hydro 
 carbon Solvent slurry feed tank; the Slurry then passes to a 
 Static mixer immediately downstream of an activator injec 
 tion port where the slurry is mixed with the activator; then the mixture passes to a Second Static mixer immediately 
 downstream of a Second activator injection port where it is 
 mixed with the Second activator. The Second activator is 
 optional, but preferred. The mixture then passes to another 
 mixer, preferably of the same kind, where it is topped-off 
 with a Small amount of activator Sufficient to complete 
 activation of the precursor, i.e., an amount Sufficient to alkylate the active site and promote polymerization. A Small 
 additional amount may also be included to counteract impu rities found in the polymerization System; however, this 
 amount is inclusive in the overall Al:Ti atomic ratio, i.e., 
 about 1:1 to about 15:1, preferably about 1:1 to about 10:1, 
 and is not in excess of that ratio. 
 The static mixer element is preferably mounted vertically 
 to prevent Solids accumulation in the mixer. It makes no 
 difference which direction the flow is going, however. A 32 
 element Static mixer in 72 inch tube size is highly efficacious. 15

 The 32 element mixer (overall length is 24.75 inch) will have a relatively low pressure drop while Still providing 
 intimate mixing of the fluid elements. The Static mixer element is preferably located downstream of the injection point of alkyl reducing agent to the precursor Slurry. There 
 is no requirement that the mixer element be within a certain minimum distance of the mix point; however, any distance from a few inches to a few feet may be acceptable depending 
 on the overall System layout and dimensions. The Static mixer element may be jacketed or not. In any case, the 
 System should, at a minimum, be insulated to prevent heat loSS to the environment. Acceptable mixing can be provided 
 by a 2 foot (32 element) Kenics TM static mixer. This low energy mixer functions by constantly dividing the flow and 
 reversing flow directions in a circular pattern in the direction 
 of the flow in the tube associated with the mixer. Depending on the activator used, Some reaction time may be required 
 for the reaction of the activator with the catalyst precursor. 
 This is conveniently done using a residence time Zone, 
 which can consist either of an additional length of slurry feed pipe or an essentially plug flow holding vessel. A 
 residence time Zone can be used for both activators, for only one or for neither, depending entirely on the rate of reaction between activator and catalyst precursor. See discussion of 
 residence time pots below. The entire mixture, after the topping-off Step, is then introduced into the reactor, usually 
 at the same time as the flow of ethylene is initiated. 
 It is noted that due to the high viscosity of the slurry, heat transfer is relatively poor (the Reynolds number is in the 1 to 10 range). Degradation can begin to occur at temperatures 
 higher than 60 degrees C. Thus, activation is normally 
 effected at temperatures in the range of about 10 to about 60 degrees C., preferably about 30 to about 45 degrees C. In any 
 case, good mixing is needed to maintain constant tempera 
 tures and allow for completion of the reaction in view of the prevalent low mass transfer coefficients in high Viscosity Systems. Intense high energy input mixing, mixing by injec 
 tion into a flowing Stream, and mixing by diffusion are not 
 recommended. 
 To assure a uniform final catalyst precursor, it is important 
 that the flow through the mixing devices be as close to plug 
 flow as possible. In addition, Some of the reactions require 
 finite amounts of time to proceed to completion So it is also necessary to provide residence time in the System. Although 
 this can be accomplished by use of long loops of pipe or tubing, the risk of catalyst precursor Settling out during 
 unavoidable outages in catalyst feed and the high preSSure 
 drop that this will cause makes this highly impractical. 
 Instead, the process of the invention is preferably carried out utilizing residence time pots designed to promote plug flow while retaining the catalyst Slurry in Suspension. 
 The design of the residence time pot is such that it will promote uniform (or close to uniform) residence times as well as constant temperature. Since plug flow is desired, designs which promote back mixing are definitely not pre 
 ferred. Although Some back mixing will naturally occur in tubing lines (due to Velocity gradients-a natural consequence of being totally in laminar flow), this is of relatively minor 
 impact. Axial mixing in the residence time pots is minimized by maintaining a high aspect ratio a preferred L/D (length 
 to diameter ratio) of about 10 to about 15). This results in a low velocity in the residence time pot and minimal back mixing due to Velocity gradients in laminar flow. 
 Some homogenization of the slurry occurs at the transi 
 tion Section from the residence time pot to the Smaller diameter feed lines. Additional radial mixing is preferably 
 provided by Small impellers, which are located near the US 6,617.405 B1 
 7 
 bottom of the residence time pot. The impeller promotes Some radial mixing, but mainly assures that the bottom Section of the residence time pot does not experience SuS pended solid buildup. 
 After activator has been added to the catalyst precursor Slurry in one or two steps, additional activator is added as a last step prior to entry into the reactor. Preferably, this 
 addition occurs within 30 minutes and preferably within less than 15 minutes of actual injection of the catalyst precursor 
 Slurry into the reactor. The activator can be in Solution in an inert Solvent (Such as a high Viscosity fluid carrier or a lower Viscosity Solvent) or added as pure component. It is essential 
 that a mixer, preferably an additional Static mixer element, be located immediately downstream of the addition point of 
 the additional activator. It is also important to keep the Slurry flowing to assure that no plugs form in the catalyst feed line. 
 Additional activator is fed to provide for sufficient activation of the catalyst plus a Small additional amount to Scavenge 
 impurities in the polymerization reactor. The total amount of 
 this additional “topping off activator can be about 0.1 to 
 about 75 percent by mol of the total amount of the activator 
 used for the activation of the precursor. Addition of all of the activator to the catalyst precursor eliminates mass transfer problems, which would prevent the activator from reaching the catalyst precursor if Separate addition to the reactor was 
 practiced. This practice leads to extremely efficient utiliza tion of activator and improved polymer product properties. 
 After completion of the mixing of activator with catalyst 
 precursor, direct injection into the reactor occurs. Means of feeding a slurry to a gas phase reactor are well known and described in the art (see European Patent Application 635 521, for example). 
 The hydrocarbon used for the formation of the slurry can 
 be any essentially air and moisture free aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon which is unreactive with the catalyst precursor, 
 the precursor activator compounds, and the cocatalyst. In 
 practice, Since many of the final polymer products find end 
 uses in food packaging, aromatic hydrocarbons would not be a preferred slurry solvent. The hydrocarbon slurry solvent is 
 typically chosen from hydrogenated “mineral oils” or naph 
 thenic oils of relatively high Viscosity to minimize Settling of 
 catalyst Solids in feed tubes and the like, although, with appropriate engineering design, lower Viscosity Solvents 
 Such as isopentane, hexane, and heptane can be used as Slurry Solvents. These are not particularly preferred due to 
 the additional complexity introduced by use of a lower Viscosity and more easily Settled slurry as catalyst. The 
 viscosity of the hydrocarbon slurry solvent, however, is sufficiently low so that the slurry can be conveniently pumped through the pre-activation apparatus and eventually 
 into the polymerization reactor. Preferred Solvents are ali phatic hydrocarbons with viscosity greater than about 50 centipoises (cps), particularly greater than about 100 cps and 
 less than about 5,000 cps. Particularly preferred solvents are 
 napthenic mineral oils typified by materials Such as the Kaydol series of food grade mineral oils supplied by Witco 
 under the trademark Kaydol(R) 350 and 550. 
 It is preferred not to use a Support. However, in those 
 cases where it is desired to Support the precursor, Silica is the preferred Support. Other Suitable Supports are inorganic 
 oxides Such as aluminum phosphate, alumina, Silica/alumina mixtures, Silica modified with an organoaluminum com pound Such as triethylaluminum, and Silica modified with diethyl Zinc. A typical Support is a Solid, particulate, porous 
 material essentially inert to the polymerization. It is used as a dry powder having an average particle Size of about 10 to 
 about 250 microns and preferably about 30 to about 100 15 
 25

 microns, a Surface area of at least 200 Square meters per gram and preferably at least about 250 Square meters per 
 gram; and a pore Size of at least about 100 angstroms and preferably at least about 200 angstroms. Generally, the 
 amount of support used is that which will provide about 0.1 
 to about 1.0 millimole of titanium per gram of Support and 
 preferably about 0.4 to about 0.9 millimole of titanium per gram of Support. Impregnation of the above mentioned catalyst precursor into a Silica Support can be accomplished 
 by mixing the precursor and Silica gel in the electron donor 
 solvent or other solvent followed by solvent removal under reduced pressure. The resultant Solid catalyst is then con verted into a free flowing Slurry with an aliphatic hydrocar 
 bon as described above Such that it is pumpable as a liquid into the process. Catalyst precursorS Such as those described 
 in U.S. Pat. No. 5,290,745 and European Patent Application 771 820 are particularly useful in the process of subject 
 invention when placed into a hydrocarbon Slurry in the 
 unactivated State. 
 The polymerization is conducted in the gas phase using a 
 continuous fluidized bed process. 
 Melt index is determined under ASTM D-1238, Condition E. It is measured at 190° C. and 2.16 kilograms and reported as grams per 10 minutes or decigrams per minute. Flow 
 index is determined under ASTM D-1238, Condition F. It is 
 measured at 190° C. and 10 times the weight used in determining the melt index, and reported as grams per 10 
 minutes or decigrams per minute. Melt flow ratio is the ratio 
 of flow index to melt index. The product, as removed from 
 the reactor, can have a melt indeX in the range of about 0.02 to about 300 grams per 10 minutes, and preferably has a melt 
 index in the range of about >0.04 to about 50 grams per 10 
 minutes. The melt flow ratio is in the range of about 20 to about 50, and is preferably in the range of about 20 to about 30. The density of the polymer is normally at least 0.900 
 gram per cubic centimeter, and is preferably in the range of 
 0.915 to 0.960 gram per cubic centimeter. The bulk density 
 can be in the range of about 18 to about 32 pounds per cubic foot, and is preferably greater than 22 pounds per cubic foot. 
 The molecular weight distribution of the polymer is reflected 
 in an Mw/Mn of about 3 to about 7. Mw is the weight average molecular weight, Mn is the number average 
 molecular weight; and the Mw/Mn ratio can be referred to as the polydispersity index, which is a measure of the 
 breadth of the molecular weight distribution. Mw/Mn can 
 also be related to MFR, with lower values of MFR indicated 
 lower values of Mw/Mn and a narrower molecular weight 
 distribution. 
 The transition metal based catalyst System including the activated precursor, ethylene, and, optionally, alpha-olefin 
 and hydrogen are continuously fed into the reactor, and the 
 final product is continuously removed from the reactor. 
 In the reactor: 
 The mole ratio of alpha-olefin (if used) to ethylene can be in the range of about 0.01:1 to about 0.8:1, and is preferably 
 in the range of about 0.02:1 to about 0.35:1. The mole ratio of hydrogen (if used) to ethylene can be in the range of about 
 0.001:1 to about 2:1, and is preferably in the range of about 0.01 to about 0.5:1. Preferred operating temperatures vary 
 depending on the density desired, i.e., lower temperatures 
 for lower densities and higher temperatures for higher 
 densities. 
 The pressure, i.e., the total pressure in the reactor, can be in the range of about 200 to about 500 psig (pounds per Square inch gauge) and is preferably in the range of about 
 280 to about 450 psig. The ethylene partial pressure can be US 6,617.405 B1 
 9 
 in the range of about 10 to about 150 psig, and is preferably 
 in the range of about >20 to about 120 psig. The balance of the total pressure is provided by alpha-olefin (if used) and an 
 inert gas Such as nitrogen. Other inert hydrocarbons, Such as an induced condensing agent e.g., isopentane, hexane also 
 contribute to the overall preSSure in the reactor according to their vapor pressure under the temperature and pressure 
 experienced in the reactor. A typical fluidized bed reactor 
 can be described as follows: 
 The bed is usually made up of the same granular resin that 
 is to be produced in the reactor. Thus, during the course of the polymerization, the bed comprises formed polymer particles, growing polymer particles, and catalyst particles 
 fluidized by polymerization and modifying gaseous compo 
 nents introduced at a flow rate or Velocity Sufficient to cause the particles to Separate and act as a fluid. The fluidizing gas 
 is made up of the initial feed, make-up feed, and cycle 
 (recycle) gas, i.e., comonomers and, if desired, modifiers and/or an inert carrier gas. 
 The essential parts of the reaction System are the vessel, 
 the bed, the gas distribution plate, inlet and outlet piping, a compressor, cycle gas cooler, and a product discharge SyS 
 tem. In the vessel, above the bed, there is a velocity 
 reduction Zone, and, in the bed, a reaction Zone. Both are above the gas distribution plate. 
 A typical fluidized bed reactor is further described in U.S. 
 Pat. No. 4,482,687. 
 The gaseous feed Streams of ethylene, other gaseous alpha-olefins (if used), and hydrogen (if used) are preferably fed to the reactor recycle line as well as liquid alpha-olefins (if used). The activated catalyst precursor is preferably 
 injected into the fluidized bed as a Solid or a mineral oil Slurry. The product composition can be varied by changing 
 the molar ratioS of the comonomers introduced into the 
 fluidized bed. The product is continuously discharged in 
 granular or particulate form from the reactor as the bed level builds up with polymerization. The production rate is con 
 trolled by adjusting the catalyst feed rate and/or the ethylene partial pressures. 
 The hydrogen:ethylene mole ratio can be adjusted to control average molecular weights. The alpha-olefins (other than ethylene) can be present in a total amount of up to 15 percent by weight of the copolymer and, if used, are pref 
 erably included in the copolymer in a total amount of about 1 to about 10 percent by weight based on the weight of the copolymer. 
 The residence time of the mixture of reactants including gaseous and liquid reactants, catalyst, and resin in the 
 fluidized bed can be in the range of about 1 to about 12 hours and is preferably in the range of about 2 to about 5 hours. 
 The reactor can be run in the condensing mode, if desired. 
 The condensing mode is described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,543, 
 399; 4,588,790; and 5,352,749. 
 The resin can be extruded in a conventional extruder 
 adapted for that purpose. Extruders and processes for extru 
 Sion are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,814, 135; 4,857,600; 
 5,076,988; and 5,153,382. Examples of various extruders, which can be used in forming film are a single Screw type 
 Such as one modified with a blown film die and air ring and continuous take off equipment, a blown film extruder, and a Slot cast extruder. A typical Single Screw type extruder can be described as one having a hopper at its upstream end and 
 a die at its downstream end. The hopper feeds into a barrel, 
 which contains a Screw. At the downstream end, between the 
 end of the Screw and the die, is a Screen pack and a breaker plate. The screw portion of the extruder is considered to be 15

 divided up into three Sections, the feed Section, the com pression Section, and the metering Section, and multiple 
 heating Zones from the rear heating Zone to the front heating 
 Zone, the multiple Sections and Zones running from upstream 
 to downstream. If it has more than one barrel, the barrels are 
 connected in Series. The length to diameter ratio of each barrel is in the range of about 16:1 to about 30:1. The extrusion can take place at temperatures in the range of 
 about 160 to about 270 degrees C., and is preferably carried 
 out at temperatures in the range of about 180 to about 240 degrees C. 
 The advantages of the invention are found in that molecu 
 lar weight distribution can be narrowed and hexane extract 
 ables can be decreased without a decrease in hydrogen response and catalyst activity; there is no rapid increase in 
 reaction rate, which can result in sheeting, chunking, and cessation of operation; reduction of the cocatalyst, i.e., activator, requirement; improved proceSS control; the pre 
 cursor is leSS Sensitive to over-reduction; catalyst fines are all active So they are less likely to Segregate and migrate to 
 the reactor wall to form sheets, facilitates activator change where different products are desired; the process allows for 
 complete activation even where the activator has very low (or nil) vapor pressure Such as tri-n-hexyl aluminum; the 
 process allows the use of leSS expensive activatorS Such as triethylaluminum and triusobutylaluminum; eliminates the 
 need for Separate cocatalyst feed; although the proceSS is 
 primarily focused on higher molecular weight (and lower levels of low molecular weight species), narrow molecular weight distribution products for fabrication into film, the process has broader application to higher melt indeX products, typically resins used in injection molding, elimi 
 nates other forms of catalyst premixing, often a unit opera tion; and allows for quick changes of catalyst by changing 
 relative flow rates of precursor and activator. 
 Conventional additives, which can be introduced into the resin product, are exemplified by antioxidants, ultraViolet absorbers, pigments, dyes, nucleating agents, fillers, Slip 
 agents, fire retardants, plasticizers, processing aids, 
 lubricants, Stabilizers, Smoke inhibitors, Viscosity control agents, and crosslinking agents, catalysts, and boosters, 
 tackifiers, and anti-blocking agents. Aside from the fillers, 
 the additives can be present in the blend in amounts of about 0.1 to about 10 parts by weight of additive for each 100 parts 
 by weight of polymer blend. Fillers can be added in amounts up to 200 parts by weight and more for each 100 parts by 
 weight of the blend.

 The invention is illustrated by the following examples. 
 EXAMPLES 1 to 4 
 Examples 1 to 4 are embodiments of the invention. In these examples, a Small polymerization reaction System, as 
 described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,290,745 and references con 
 tained therein, is used. Instead of manipulating the activator/ 
 electron donor ratioS in an in-line fashion as indicated in the 
 discussion of the preferred mode, the partially activated precursors are prepared in a batch fashion due to the extreme difficulty encountered in metering activator compound flows 
 which would be at rates of about 1 to 3 cubic centimeters per 
 hour. These results are illustrative of the effect of the 
 invention in manipulating polymer properties in an in-line US 6,617.405 B1 
 11 
 fashion over a larger range of polymer MFR (melt flow ratio), hexane extractables, and polymer bulk density. The Smaller reaction System is used illustratively to avoid experi 
 mentation in large commercial equipment, which can result in large amounts of off-specification polymer during the 
 experiment. The results described below, however, are directly Scalable to large Scale commercial reaction Systems. 
 Note: ratioS are mole ratioS unless otherwise Stated. 
 Catalyst Precursor Preparation 
 A titanium trichloride containing catalyst precursor is 
 prepared in a 1900 liter vessel equipped with pressure and temperature controls and a turbine agitator. A nitrogen 
 atmosphere (less than 5 ppm H2O) is maintained at all times. 1480 liters of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (THF, the internal 
 electron donor) containing less than 40 ppm H2O are added to the vessel. The THF is heated to a temperature of 50 degrees C., and 1.7 kilograms of granular magnesium metal 
 (70.9 gram atoms) are added, followed by 27.2 kilograms of titanium tetrachloride (137 mols). The magnesium metal has a particle size in the range of from 0.1 to 4 millimeters. The 
 titanium tetrachloride is added over a period of about 
 one-half hour. 
 The mixture is continuously agitated. The exotherm 
 resulting from the addition of titanium tetrachloride causes the temperature of the mixture to rise to approximately 72 
 degrees C. Over a period of about three hours. The tempera 
 ture is held at about 70 degrees C. by heating for approxi 
 mately another four hours. At the end of this time, 61.7 kilograms of magnesium dichloride (540 moles) are added and heating is continued at 70 degrees C. for another eight 
 hours. The mixture (solution) is then filtered through a 100 micron filter to remove undissolved magnesium dichloride and unreacted magnesium (less than 0.5 percent by weight). 
 100 kilograms of fumed Silica having a particle Size in the 
 range of from 0.1 to 1 microns are added to the mixture prepared above over a period of about two hours. The 
 mixture is stirred by means of a turbine agitator during this 
 time and for Several hours thereafter to thoroughly disperse 
 the Silica in the Solution. The temperature of the mixture is held at 70 degrees C. throughout this period and a nitrogen 
 atmosphere is maintained at all times. 
 The resulting Slurry is spray dried using an 8-foot diam 
 eter closed cycle spray dryer equipped with a rotary atom izer. The rotary atomizer is adjusted to give catalyst particles 
 with a D50 of 18 microns. The scrubber section of the spray dryer is maintained at approximately minus 4 degrees C. 
 Nitrogen gas is introduced into the Spray dryer at an inlet 
 temperature of 165 degrees C. and is circulated at a rate of approximately 1700 kilograms per hour. The catalyst Slurry 
 is fed to the Spray dryer at a temperature of about 35 degrees 
 C. and a rate of 90 to 95 kilograms per hour, or sufficient to yield an outlet gas temperature of approximately 125 
 degrees C. The atomization pressure is slightly above atmo Spheric. Discrete Spray dried catalyst precursor particles are 
 formed. 
 The Spray dried catalyst precursor contains 2.5 weight percent Ti, 6.3 weight percent Mg, and 25 to 29 weight 
 percent THF. The particles have a D50 of 14 microns and a span (D90-D10)/D50 ranging from 0.75 to 1.25 as deter mined by means of a Leeds and Northrup Microtrac(R) particle size analyzer using a dodecane Solvent, The discrete 
 catalyst precursor particles are mixed with mineral oil under 
 a nitrogen atmosphere in a 400 liter vessel equipped with a turbine agitator to form a slurry containing approximately 28 
 weight percent of the Solid catalyst precursor. 15

 To partially activate the catalyst Slurry, a 50 weight 
 percent solution of tri-n-hexylaluminum (TnHAI) in mineral 
 oil is added to the slurry followed by mixing for approxi 
 mately 72 hour. The TnHAI solution is employed in an 
 amount sufficient to provide 0.20 mole of TnHAI per mole of THF in the catalyst. Sequentially, then a 30 weight 
 percent solution of diethylaluminum chloride (DEAC) in 
 mineral oil is added and the mixture is mixed and held for 
 approximately 1 hour. The DEAC is employed in an amount 
 sufficient to provide 0.45 mole of DEAC per mole of THF 
 in the catalyst. The mole ratio of total activator (TnHAI plus 
 DEAC) to THF is 0.65:1. 
 Ethylene is copolymerized with 1-butene in a fluidized 
 bed reactor as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,349,648. Each polymerization is continuously conducted after equilibrium 
 is reached under conditions set forth in Table I. Polymer 
 ization is initiated in the reactor by continuously feeding the 
 above preactivated catalyst precursor into a fluidized bed of 
 polyethylene granules together with ethylene, 1-hexene, and 
 hydrogen. In example 1, an activator (in this case, a 
 cocatalyst) is dissolved in isopentane (iC5) and fed to reactor Separately from the preactivated catalyst. 
 Example 1 is repeated in examples 2 to 4 with the 
 exception that the activator is now admixed with the catalyst 
 in a final Step prior to addition to the reactor. Preactivated 
 catalyst and triethylaluminum activator are mixed in-line for 
 approximately 1 to 1.5 minutes. No external activator is fed 
 to the reactor. The reaction conditions are set forth in Table 
 I. The MFR and the bulk density are shown in Table II. It 
 will be noted that the MFR and bulk density of the blend 
 change with changes in the total activator/electron donor 
 mole ratio with little change in other polymer properties or 
 reaction conditions. Although the change in MFR is Small, 
 changes of this kind can have significant effects on end use 
 properties as indicated in U.S. Pat. No. 4,349,648, men 
 tioned above. The change in Settled bulk density is greater with the highest bulk density (example 4) occurring at the 
 lowest total activator/electron donor mole ratio.

 EXAMPLES 5 to 9 
 Examples 5 to 9 are also embodimets of the invention. Catalyst is prepared as in Example 1. The Same reaction 
 System is used. In these examples, however, 1-hexene is used as comonomer and trimethylaluminum as activator. In the control (example 5), the activator (cocatalyst) is fed Separately to the fluidized bed as a Solution in isopentane. 15 14 
 U.S. Pat. No. 5,068,489 is used in Comparative Examples 1, 
 3, 5, and 6. In the examples using a Silica impregnated 
 catalyst, the catalyst is introduced to the reactor as a dry 
 powder. In Comparative Examples 2, 4, 7, and 8, the catalyst 
 is fed to the reactor as a slurry. In these examples, the 
 activator (cocatalyst) is fed separately to the polymerizing 
 bed. The spray dried slurry fed catalyst of Comparative 
 Examples 2, 4, 7, and 8 is normally of higher productivity 
 and hence lower residual titanium level than the Silica 
 impregnated catalyst. This is illustrated by comparing Com 
 parative Examples 1 and 2. Note, that despite Similar reac 
 tion conditions, much higher residual titanium levels are 
 observed at these low activator:Timolar ratios, even though 
 the activator:ED molar ratios are much higher than those in Examples 1 to 9 illustrating the invention; also note the 
 substantially lower residual titanium for the catalysts of the 
 invention. Thus, a much more efficacious use of cocatalyst 
 activator is achieved by the process of the invention, as well 
 0 as achieving the same results in terms of reduced MFR i.e., 
 narrower molecular weight distribution (MWD) and lower hexane extractables. Both catalyst productivity and activa 
 tor utilization effectiveneSS are improved through addition of 
 the activator directly with the activated catalyst precursor composition in a hydrocarbon slurry.

 Examples 6 to 9 utilize activator mixed directly with the 
 preactivated catalyst in-line prior to introduction to the TABLE IV reactor. Since all of these examples use trimethylaluminum as activator, the effect of the invention on MFR is more 55 - Examples 
 difficult to ascertain Since this particular activator normally 
 gives low MFR values under any set of circumstances. The 
 effect on bulk density, however, is still clear as is the relatively high catalyst productivity observed, even at very 
 low Al/Tilevels. Variables and results can be found in Tables 
 III and IV.

Instead of manipulating the activator/electron donor ratioS in an in-line fashion as indicated in the discussion of the preferred mode, the partially activated precursors are prepared in a batch fashion due to the extreme difficulty encountered in metering activator compound flows which would be at rates of about 1 to 3 cubic centimeters per hour. These results are illustrative of the effect of the invention in manipulating polymer properties in an in-line fashion over a larger range of polymer MFR (melt flow ratio), hexane extractables, and polymer bulk density. The Smaller reaction System is used illustratively to avoid experimentation in large commercial equipment, which can result in large amounts of off-specification polymer during the experiment.

 BACKGROUND 
 The present invention relates to a method for poly merizing alpha-olefins, a catalyst for such a polymeriza 
 tion and a method for producing such a catalyst. A particular aspect of the present invention relates to a method for producing linear low density polyethylene. Linear low density polyethylene polymers possess properties which distinguish them from other polyeth ylene polymers such as homopolymers of polyethylene. 
 Certain of these properties are described in the Ander son et al U.S. Pat. No. 4,076,698. 
 The Karol et al U.S. Pat. No. 4,302,566 describes a process for producing certain linear low density poly ethylene polymers in a gas phase, fluid bed reactor. 
 The Graff U.S. Pat. No. 4,173,547, Stevens et al U.S. 
 Pat. No. 3,787,384, Strobel et al U.S. Pat. No. 4,148,754 and the Ziegler, deceased et al U.S. Pat. No. 4,063,009 each describe various polymerization processes suitable for producing forms of polyethylene other than linear 
 low density polyethylene, per se. W 
 The Graff U.S. Pat. No. 4,173,547 describes a sup ported catalyst obtained by treating a support with both an organoaluminum compound and an organomag 
 nesium compound followed by contacting this treated support with a tetravalent titanium compound. 
 The Stevens et al U.S. Pat. No. 3,787,384 and the Strobel et al U.S. Pat. No. 4,148,754 describe a catalyst prepared by first reacting a support (e.g., silica contain ing reactive hydroxy groups) with an organomag inesium compound (e.g., a Grignard reagent) and then combining this reacted support with a tetravalent tita nium compound. According to the teachings of both of these patents, no unreacted organomagnesium com pound would seem to be present when the reacted sup port is contacted with the tetravalent titanium com pound. 
 The Ziegler, deceased et al U.S. Pat. No. 4,063,009 describes a catalyst which is the reaction product of an organomagnesium compound (e.g., an alkylmagnesium 
 halide) with a tetravalent titanium compound. This reaction with the tetravalent titanium compound takes place in the absence of a support material.

 DETALED OESCRIPTION 
 In accordance with an aspect of the present inven tion, supported titanium is incorporated onto a suitable support by impregnating this support with reactive magnesium and utilizing this supported reactive magne 
 sium to react with tetravalent titanium (i.e., titanium in the plus 4 valence state) in a liquid medium. Unreacted titanium is soluble in this liquid medium, while reacted titanium and supported reactive magnesium are insolu 
 ble in this liquid medium. As used herein, the concept of supporting a material 
 on a carrier is intended to connote the incorporation of material (e.g., magnesium compositions and/or titan tium compositions) onto the carrier by physical or chemical means. Accordingly, supported material need not necessarily be chemically bound to the carrier. Catalysts produced according to aspects of the pres 
 ent invention may be described in terms of the manner in which they can be made. More particularly, these catalysts can be described in terms of the manner in which a suitable carrier may be treated in order to form such catalysts. 
 Suitable carrier materials which may be treated in clude solid, porous carrier materials such as silica, alu mina and combinations thereof. Such carrier materials 
 may be amorphous or crystalline in form. These carriers may be in the form of particles having a particle size of 
 from about 0.1 micron to about 200 microns, more pref erably from about 10 to about 80 microns. Preferably, the carrier is in the form of spherical particles, e.g., spray dried silica. The internal porosity of these carriers may be larger than 0.2 cm/gm, e.g., larger than about 0.6 cm/g. The specific surface area of these carriers may be larger than about 50 m2/g, e.g., from about 150 to about 1500 m2/g. It is desirable to remove physically bound water from the carrier material prior to contacting this material with water-reactive magnesium compounds. This water removal may be accomplished by heating the carrier 
 material to a temperature from about 100° C. to an upper limit of temperature represented by the tempera 
 ture at which change of state or sintering occurs. A suitable range of temperatures may, thus, be from about 
 100° C. to about 800° C., e.g., from about 150° C. to 
 about 250 C. w 4,481,301 5 Chemically bound water, as represented by a pres ence of OH groups in the carrier, may be present when the carrier is contacted with water-reactive magnesium compounds in accordance with an aspect of the present invention. This chemically bound water may be present as about 0.3 mmoles or more of OH groups per gram of carrier. Accordingly, an amount of, e.g., from about 0.5 to about 5 mmoles of OH groups per gram of carrier may be present, but a preferred range is from about 0.3 to about 0.7 mmoles of OH groups per gram of carrier. Excess OH groups present in the carrier may be re moved by heating the carrier for a sufficient time at a sufficient temperature to accomplish the desired re moval. More particularly, for example, a relatively small number of OH groups may be removed by suffi cient heating at from about 150 C. to about 250 C., whereas a relatively large number of OH groups may be removed by sufficient heating at at least 500 or 600 C., most especially, about from about 750° C. to about 850' C. The duration of heating may be overnight, e.g., 16 hours or a shorter period, e.g., at least 4 hours. The surface hydroxyl concentration of silica may be deter mined according to J. B. Peri and A. L. Hensley, Jr., J. Phys. Chem, 72 (8), 2926 (1968). While heating is a preferred means of removing OH groups inherently present in a carrier such as silica, other removal means are also possible such as chemical means. For example, a desired proportion of OH groups may be reacted with a chemical agent such as a hy droxyl reactive aluminum compound, e.g., triethylalu 
 Examples of suitable carrier materials are described in the Graff, U.S. Pat. No. 4,173,547. Note particularly the passage extending from column 3, line 62 to column 5, line 44 of this Graff patent. It is noted that internal porosity of carriers can be determined by a technique termed BET-technique, described by S. Brunauer, P. Emmett and E. Teller in Journal of the American Chemi cal Society, 60, pp. 209-319 (1938). Specific surface areas of carriers can also be measured in accordance with the above-mentioned BET-technique, with use of the stan dardized method as described in British Standards BS 
 4359, Volume 1, (1969). Further examples of carrier materials are given in the Stevens et al., U.S. Pat. No. 3,718,636. Note particularly the passage extending from line 12 to line 29 of column 3 of this Stevens etal patent. Also included as examples of carrier materials are polymeric silicas known as poly siloxanes. 
 An example of a preferred carrier is silica which has been dehydrated by fluidizing with nitrogen and heat 
 ing at about 800 C. for about 16 hours to achieve a surface hydroxyl concentration of about 0.5 mmols/g. The silica used may be a high surface area, amorphous silica (surface area=300 m2/g; pore volume of 1.65 cm3 per gram) marketed under the tradename Davison 952 by the Davison Division of W. R. Grace and Co. A suitable dehydrated carrier material may be further treated by impregnating same with a solid magnesium containing composition which is capable of reacting with a tetravalent titanium compound. One such mag nesium containing material is an organomagnesium composition of the formula RMgR'(2-m), where R and R"" are the same or different and represent stable organic moieties, provided that R' may also be halogen, and n is a rational number from about 0.5 to 2. A particular example of a solution of such an organomagnesium composition is a Grignard reagent, O

 Grignard reagents are described in Organic Chemis 
 try, Second Edition, Morrison and Boyd, fifth printing, May 1968, pp. 112-114 and 516-521. Grignard reagents 
 are known to react with organic molecules or moieties which have hydrogen bonded directly to a nitrogen or 
 oxygen atom. Furthermore, Grignard reagents are also 
 known to react with organic molecules or moieties containing carbonyl groups, cyano groups and nitro 
 groups. Accordingly, stable organic moieties as defined 
 by R in the above-mentioned formula generally would not have any of the above-mentioned groups indicated as being reactive with Grignard reagents. Thus, exam 
 ples of R and R' include C1-C12 hydrocarbyl groups (e.g., C1-C12 alkyl or C6-C12 aryl) or C1-C12 alkoxy 
 groups, which may be unsubstituted or substituted, e.g., with one or more of halogen (e.g., F, Cl, Br or I), C1-C12 alkoxy, etc. A preferred composition according to the formula R,MgR'(2-) is ethylmagnesium chlo 
 ride. 
 It is noted that even a Grignard reagent of ethylmag nesium chloride may contain a mixture of molecules other than ethylmagnesium chloride, per se. For exam 
 ple, particularly under the influence of various liquids or solvent systems, ethylmagnesium chloride may dis proportionate to form essentially a mixture of magne 
 sium dichloride and diethylmagnesium. Such mixtures 
 are intended to be encompassed within the formula RMgR'2 in). Accordingly, it will be understood that compositions of the formula R,MgR'(2-m) and composi 
 tions representative thereof are intended herein to rep resent the overall empirical formula of these composi tions rather than to set forth the molecular formula of these compositions. Preferably, the carrier should be impregnated such that the pores of same contain reactive solid magnesium containing composition. A preferred means of accom 
 plishing this result is by incorporating a porous carrier 
 in a liquid medium containing a dissolved organomag 
 nesium composition of the formula R,MgR'(2-) and to cause magnesium to become impregnated into the pores 
 of the carrier by (1) a reaction of the organomagnesium composition with the carrier, by (2) a precipitation of magnesium from the organomagnesium composition 
 onto the carrier or by (3) a combination of such reaction and precipitation. Organo-magnesium compositions corresponding to 
 those found in Grignard reagents have the formula 
 RMgX, where R is as defined hereinabove and X is halogen, (e.g., Cl, Br or I), and are soluble in ethers. . Examples of such ethers are mentioned on column 4, lines 32-49 of the Yamaguchi et al. U.S. Pat. No. 3,989,881 and include aliphatic ethers, such as diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether, dibutyl ether, dipentyl ether 
 and ethyl-n-butyl ether and cyclic ethers such as tetra hydrofuran and dioxane. It has been theorized that the reason for the ability of such ethers (e.g., diethyl ether to solubilize such organomagnesium compositions (e.g., 
 65 C2H5MgCl) is by virtue of the ability of the magnesium 
 atom to act as a Lewis acid and to associate with at least one electron pair from the etheric oxygen which acts as a Lewis base. Such an association is represented as 
 follows: 4,481,301 
 C2H5 
 O 
 Although organomagnesium compounds of the for 
 mula RMgX tend to be insoluble in non-Lewis base solvents such as hexane, these organomagnesium com pounds may be completely soluble in mixed solvent systems such as hexane/tetrahydrofuran, provided that 
 a sufficient solubilizing amount of the Lewis base sol vent is present. Thus, according to one aspect of the present invention, a carrier may be slurried in a non Lewis base co-solvent and an organomagnesium com pound may be added thereto in the form of an ether solution thereof. Examples of non-Lewis base co-sol vents are given in the passage extending from column 6, 
 line 61 to column 7, line 8 of the Graff U.S. Pat. No. 4,173,547. These co-solvents include straight or branched saturated aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as butanes, pentanes, hexanes, heptanes, or commonly available mixtures thereof, generally known as gasoline, kerosene, gas, oil or other petroleum fractions. Further, such co-solvents include cyclic hydrocarbons, such as cyclopentane, cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane, as well as aromatic hydrocarbons, such as benzene or halogen aromatic hydrocarbons such as chlorobenzene. It is noted that such co-solvents should preferably not con tain groups which are reactive with the organomag nesium composition. A preferred co-solvent is n-hex 
 2. According to another aspect of the present invention, carrier is impregnated with magnesium composition by suitably contacting this carrier with a liquid containing organomagnesium composition of the formula RMgR'2-) in a partially dissolved state. More partic ularly, the carrier may be slurried in one of the above exemplified non-Lewis base co-solvents, such as hex ane, and a solution of Grignard in ether may be added thereto, the amount of ether relative to the amount of co-solvent being sufficient to only partially solubilize the Grignard. The non-soluble portion of the Grignard 5

 Accordingly, it may be possible to incorporate a magnesium composition onto a carrier by reacting an organomagnesium composition with reactive OH 
 groups of the carrier. Another means of incorporating a magnesium com position onto a carrier is to precipitate magnesium from an organomagnesium composition from a liquid onto a carrier. This precipitation may take place by any possi ble convenient means including cooling of the solvent, using a sufficiently large amount of non-solvent in the initial slurry, adding non-solvent to the slurry or strip ping off solvent. In the case of a carrier slurry where the liquid medium is essentially a hexane/tetrahydrofuran solution of ethylmagnesium chloride, it is preferred to precipitate ethylmagnesium chloride onto the carrier by distillation of the solvent. In this regard, it is noted that tetrahydrofuran and hexane have nearly equivalent boiling points. Thus, it would be expected that during the course of distilling these solvents, the ratio of tetra hydrofuran to hexane in the liquid state would remain essentially constant. On the other hand, if the boiling point of the co-solvent is significantly greater than the boiling point of the ether, then the relative concentra tion of co-solvent may increase appreciably as the distill lation proceeds. In such a case, a non-uniform precipita tion of magnesium may occur, such that any magnesium dihalide which is present tends to precipitate before organomagnesium is precipitated. Particularly in view of the above discussion, it will be understood that at least three possible types of sup ported magnesium compositions can be obtained. The first type is essentially a reaction product of an or ganomagnesium composition with a carrier having OH functionalities which are reactive with this organomag nesium composition. This product would contain essen tially no precipitated organomagnesium composition. 
 40 Examples of such reaction products are given in the 
 may be in the form of dihalomagnesium, the amount of 45 this non-soluble dihalomagnesium being essentially equivalent to an amount of dialkylmagnesium remaining 
 soluble in the solvent/co-solvent mixture. It is noted that if the organomagnesium compound is only sparingly soluble, e.g., to the extent of even l per cent or less, reactive organomagnesium which is con sumed by reactive sites on the carrier will be replaced by further dissolution of undissolved organomagnesium by a mass action effect. Another example of a means of impregnating is to slurry the carrier in a Lewis base solvent such as an ether and to add a solution of organomagnesium in ether to this slurry, the addition of organomagnesi 
 um/ether solution to ether or co-solvent/carrier slurry may take place as a gradual continuous dropwise addi tion while the liquid medium of the slurry is maintained under reflux conditions. Upon such addition, dissolved organomagnesium composition may react with the car rier at the site of reactive OH groups, if any, appearing on the available surface area of the carrier. Such a reac tion may be demonstrated with respect to ethylmag 
 nesium chloride as follows: 50 
 55 
 65 aforementioned Stevens et al U.S. Pat. No. 3,787,384 
 and Strobel et al U.S. Pat. No. 4,148,754. A second type of product is essentially an or ganomagnesium composition supported on a carrier. This product would contain essentially no reaction product of organomagnesium with the carrier. Such a product could result when an organomagnesium com position is precipitated onto a carrier having essentially no OH functionalities reactive with the organomag nesium composition. A third type of product contains both reacted or ganomagnesium composition and precipitated or ganomagnesium composition. Such a product could result when an excess of organomagnesium is precipi tated in the presence of a carrier containing reactive OH 
 functionalities. Accordingly, magnesium may be incorporated onto a 
 carrier in either an unreacted form or in a reacted form, this reaction taking place between reactive hydroxyl groups of the carrier and an organomagnesium compo sition. The molar ratio of organomagnesium composi tion used to impregnate the carrier with respect to the hydroxyl groups of the carrier may be, e.g., from about 0.5 to about 3. When an excess of organomagnesium is used, this ratio may be, e.g., from about 1.1 to about 2.5. Whether magnesium is in the form of a reaction prod 
 uct with the carrier or in the form of a non-reacted precipitate, it is noted that this supported magnesium 4,481,301 
 may, optionally, be in the form of a complex with one or more electron donating agents (i.e. Lewis bases). More particularly, when ethylmagnesium chloride is precipi tated from a hexane/tetrahydrofuran solution, each mole of ethylmagnesium chloride precipitated may be complexed with approximately one mole of tetrahydro furan. In more general terms, when an organomag nesium composition is precipitated from a solution con taining an ether, the resulting precipitate may have molecules of this ether complexed with molecules of the organomagnesium composition. The amount of magnesium composition which is impregnated onto the carrier should be sufficient to react with tetravalent titanium in order to incorporate a catalytically effective amount of titanium on the carrier in the manner set forth hereinbelow. More particularly, for example, from about 0.1 to about 5 or even 50 mmoles of magnesium may be impregnated per gram of carrier initially present. When a liquid containing an organomagnesium composition is contacted with a car rier the amount of magnesium in this liquid in terms of mmoles may be essentially the same as that stated above with respect to that which is impregnated onto the 
 carrier. 
 When a non-Lewis base co-solvent is used to slurry the carrier, an amount of such co-solvent sufficient to slurry such carrier may be used. More particularly, for 
 example, from about 2 to about 100 mls of such co-sol vent may be present per gram of carrier. A preferred 
 narrower range would be from about 5 to about 15 mls of co-solvent per gram of carrier. The amount and concentration of organomagnesi um/ether solution which is added to the co-solvent/car rier slurry are preferably sufficient to assure that the organomagnesium composition is at least partially solu 
 ble in the co-solvent/solvent system. Thus, this amount is dependent upon many factors such as the composition of solvents and organomagnesium, the temperature of 
 the co-solvent/solvent system, etc. However, it will be readily understood that the selection of proper amounts and concentrations of organomagnesium/ether solu tions is well within the ability of those of ordinary skill in the art. More particularly, for example, when an ethylmagnesium chloride/tetrahydrofuran solution is 
 added to a hexane/carrier slurry, the concentration of the ethylmagnesium chloride/tetrahydrofuran solution 
 may be from about 0.1 to about 10 Molar. A preferred narrower range would be from about 1 to about 3 Mo 
 lar. For example, when 107 g of silicic acid are suspended in 500 ml of n-heptane and 342 ml of a solution of 172 mmols of n-propyl magnesium chloride in diethyl ether are added thereto in accordance with Example 1 of the Strobel et al U.S. Pat. No. 4,148,754, the n-propyl mag nesium chloride may well be totally soluble in the n heptane/diethyl ether mixture. However, when 15 g of silica are slurried in 200 ml of n-hexane and 50 ml of a 2.0 molar solution of ethylmagnesium chloride in tetra hydrofuran is added thereto in accordance with Exam ple 1 given herein, infra, the ethylmagnesium chloride appears to be only partially soluble in the n-hexane/tet rahydrofuran mixture. While the above-exemplified methods of incorporat ing a solid reactive magnesium composition onto a car rier are preferred, it will be understood that alternative methods are available. For instance, it is possible to precipitate a dialkylmagnesium composition onto a car rier from a hydrocarbyl or halohydrocarbyl solvent 10

 containing essentially no ether. It is also possible to combine carrier and a solid organomagnesium composi 
 tion in the absence of a solvent by means of a ball mill ing device. However, such a ball milling process is less preferred, particularly because it does not tend to effec tively incorporate a reactive magnesium compound into 
 the pores of the carrier. It is particularly noted that mechanical shearing means such as ball milling are not necessary to achieve the desired impregnation of catalyst onto carrier in accordance with aspects of the present invention. Ac cordingly, a ball milling process such as described in 
 Examples 2-5 of the Grant U.S. Pat. No. 3,821,186 is unnecessary and may be avoided. Moreover, a ball milling process may tend to disrupt the particle size and morphology of the carrier. Since catalysts made in ac cordance with aspects of the present invention are pref erably capable of being used in gas phase, fluid bed polymerizations, e.g., as described in the Karol et al U.S. Pat. No. 4,302,566, the particle size and morphol ogy of the catalyst may be rather critical. Accordingly, another reason for avoiding ball milling is to preserve the particle size and morphology of the carrier while it is being treated in accordance with aspects of the pres 
 ent invention. The solid supported magnesium-containing composi tion is preferably in the form of a free-flowing powder 
 when dry. It is particularly noted that when a carrier is impregnated by many of the above-exemplified meth 
 ods neither the carrier nor the magnesium is contacted with either an organoaluminum compound or an alumi num halide compound. Thus, such a treatment with a significant amount of an organoaluminum compound or an aluminum halide compound is preferably not part of the present invention. A carrier treated with an organomagnesium composi tion according to the above-exemplified methods may 
 be reacted with a tetravalent titanium compound in a liquid medium. The tetravalent titanium compound is soluble in this liquid reaction medium, while the treated carrier, including the magnesium containing portion 
 thereof, is insoluble in this liquid reaction medium. Thus, the reaction which takes place between the tetra valent titanium and the reactive magnesium-containing composition is a reaction of a solid with a liquid. It is 
 further noted that the reacted titanium is insoluble in the 
 liquid reaction medium. The reaction which takes place between a solid, sup ported organomagnesium compound and tetravalent 
 titanium in the liquid reaction medium is felt to be essen tially an oxidation/reduction reaction, wherein the or ganomagnesium composition acts as a reducing agent 
 for the tetravalent titanium. On the other hand, while not wishing to be bound by any particular theory or 
 chemical mechanism, the reaction which takes place between (1) tetravalent titanium and (2) the reaction product of a Grignard reagent and carrier containing reactive OH groups is not felt to be an oxidation/reduc tion reaction. However, it is noted that both of the above-mentioned reactions lead to the incorporation of titanium onto a support corresponding to the treated 
 carrier. Examples of tetravalent titanium compounds, which may be used in the liquid reaction medium, are given in the passage extending from line 35 to line 54 of column 6 of the Graff U.S. Pat. No. 4,173,547. Such examples include titanium halides (e.g., where the halide portion thereof is C or Br), titanium alkoxides (e.g., where the 4,481,301 11 
 alkoxide portion thereof is a C1-C6 alkoxide), or mix tures thereof. A preferred tetravalent titanium com pound is TiCl4. It may also be possible to replace some or all of the above-mentioned tetravalent titanium compounds with one or more other transition metal compounds. Such other transition metal compounds are exemplified in the passage extending from line 55 to line 60 of column 6 of 
 the Graffetal U.S. Pat. No. 4,173,547. Preferred transi tion metal compounds include zirconium compounds (e.g., ZrCl4) and, especially, vanadium compounds (e.g., VCl3). The liquid portion of the liquid reaction medium is preferably a solution of the tetravalent titanium com pound in a solvent which may be one or more of the organic liquids exemplified hereinabove as being suit able for use as a co-solvent in the impregnation of the carrier with reactive magnesium composition. A pre 
 ferred solvent for the tetravalent titanium compound is n-heptane. 
 The reaction of the tetravalent titanium compound in the liquid medium conveniently takes place by slurrying 
 the solid carrier containing the reactive magnesium composition in a solution of the tetravalent titanium compound and heating the liquid reaction medium to a suitable reaction temperature, e.g., to the reflux temper ature of the solvent at standard atmospheric pressure. Thus, the reaction may take place under reflux condi 
 tions. 
 The various reaction parameters are subject to a wide variety of possibilities, suitable selection of such param eters being well within the skill of those having ordi nary skill in the art. However, for example, the volume of tetravalent titanium solution to treated carrier ini 
 tially slurried in the solution may be from about 0.1 to about 10 mls per gram of such carrier. The concentra tion of the tetravalent titanium solution may be, for example, from about 0.1 to about 5 Molar. The amount of tetravalent titanium in solution may be, e.g., in excess of the molar amount of organomagnesium earlier used to treat the carrier. More particularly, for example, the molar ratio of tetravalent titanium to organomagnesium may be from about 1 to about 10, more particularly from about 3 to about 6. These ratios given for tetrava lent titanium to organomagnesium are generally repre sentative of acceptable ratios for tetravalent titanium to measurable hydroxyl groups on the carrier. Unreacted titanium may be removed by suitable separation tech niques such as decantation, filtration and washing. The supported catalyst may be activated with suit 
 able activators. Such suitable activators include those organometallic compounds described in the passage 
 extending from column 4, line 45 to column 5, line 12 of 
 the Stevens et al U.S. Pat. No. 3,787,384 and in the passage extending from column 4, line 56 to column 5, 
 line 59 of the Strobel et al U.S. Pat. No. 4,148,754. A preferred activator is triethylaluminum. The catalyst may be activated in situ by adding the activator and catalyst separately to the polymerization 
 medium. It is also possible to combine the catalyst and activator before introduction into the polymerization medium, e.g., for up to about 2 hours at a temperature from about - 40' to about 80° C. Still other types of combinations of catalysts and activators are possible (note the passage extending from line 50 to line 60 in column 5 of the Stevens et al U.S. Pat. No. 3,787,384. A suitable activating amount of the activator may be used. The number of moles of activator per gram atom 5

 of titanium in the catalyst may be, e.g., from about 1 to about 100 and is preferably greater than about 5 (note the passage extending from column 5, line 71 to column 
 6, line 2 of the Stevens et al U.S. Pat. No. 3,787,384). Alpha-olefins may be polymerized with the catalysts prepared according to aspects of the present invention by any suitable process. Such processes include poly 
 merizations carried out in suspension, in solution or in the gas phase (note the passage extending from line 25 
 to line 31 in column 6 of the Strobel et al U.S. Pat. No. 
 4,148,754 and the passage extending from line 32 to line 
 49 in column 5 of the Stevens et all U.S. Pat. No. 
 3,787,384. Gas phase polymerizations are preferred 
 such as those taking place in stirred bed reactors and, especially, fluidized bed reactors. The molecular weight of the polymer may be con trolled in a known manner, preferably by using hydro gen. With the catalysts produced according to aspects 
 of the present invention, molecular weight may be suit ably controlled with hydrogen when the polymeriza tion is carried out at relatively low temperatures, e.g., 
 from about 30 to about 105 C. This control of molecu 
 lar weight may be evidenced by a measurable positive melt index for the polymer produced. The catalysts prepared according to aspects of the 
 present invention are highly active and may have an activity of at least about 5.8, e.g., from about 5.8 to about 11.6 in terms of grams of polymer produced per hour per mmole of Tiper kPa of ethylene pressure. The catalysts prepared according to aspects of the present invention are particularly useful for the produc tion of linear low density polyethylene polymers. Such linear low density polyethylene polymers may have a density of 0.94 g/cc or less, preferably 0.930 or less or even 0.925 g/cc or less. In accordance with certain aspects of the present invention, it is possible to achieve densities of less than 0.915 g/cc and even 0.900 g/cc or 
 less. Advantageous properties of linear low density poly 
 ethylene polymers are described in the Anderson et al U.S. Pat. No. 4,076,698. These linear low density poly ethylene polymers may be polymers of ethylene with one or more C3-C10 alpha-olefins. Thus, copolymers having two monomeric units are possible as well as terpolymers having three monomeric units. Particular examples of such polymers include ethylene/1-butene copolymers, ethylene/1-hexene copolymers, ethylene/4-methyl-1-pentene copolymers, ethylene/1- butene/1-hexene terpolymers, ethylene/propylene/1- hexene terpolymers and ethylene/propylene/1-butene terpolymers. When propylene is employed as a como nomer, the resulting linear low density polyethylene polymer preferably has at least one other alpha-olefin 
 comonomer having at least four carbon atoms in an amount of, e.g., at least 1 percent by weight of the poly mer. Accordingly, ethylene/propylene copolymers are possible, but not preferred. The linear low density polyethylene polymers pro 
 duced in accordance with certain aspects of the present invention preferably contain at least about 80 percent by weight of ethylene units. A particularly desirable method for producing linear low density. polyethylene polymers, according to an 
 aspect of the present invention, is felt to be via a fluid bed reactor. Such a reactor and means for operating 
 same is described in the Levine et al U.S. Pat. No. 
 4,011,382 or the Karoletal U.S. Pat. No. 4,302,566. The activity of the catalyst produced in accordance with 4,481,301 13 
 certain aspects of the present invention is felt to be sufficient to produce a linear low density polyethylene polymer which is an ethylene/1-hexene copolymer, e.g., having a density of less than 0.930 g/cc, in such a 
 fluid bed reactor. 
 As described in the Karol et al U.S. Pat. No. 4,302,566, a preferred process for conducting a gas phase, fluid bed polymerization is as follows. The polymerization reaction is conducted by contact ing a stream of the monomers, in a gas phase process, such as in the fluid bed process described below, and substantially in the absence of catalyst poisons such as moisture, oxygen, CO, CO2, and acetylene with a cata lytically effective amount of the completely activated catalyst at a temperature and at a pressure sufficient to 
 initiate the polymerization reaction. .:* In order to achieve the desired density ranges in th copolymers it is necessary to copolymerize enough of 
 the 2C3 comonomers with ethylene to achieve a level of >0 to 10 mol percent of the C3 to C8 comonomer in the copolymer. The amount of comonomer needed to achieve this result will depend on the particular comonomer(s) employed. In accordance with the invention, it has unexpectedly been found that using a gas phase catalytic polymeriza 
 tion reaction, 1-hexene (e.g. normal 1-hexene, and/or 4-methyl-1-pentene) can be incorporated into an ethyl ene polymer chain with high efficiency. In other words, a relatively small concentration of 1-hexene monomer in the gas phase reactor can lead to a relatively large incorporation of 1-hexene into the polymer. Thus, 1 hexene can be incorporated into an ethylene polymer chain in a gas phase reactor in amounts up to 20 percent by weight, preferably 5 to 11 percent by weight, to produce linear low density, polyethylene having a den sity of less than 0.930 g/cc. The reaction is preferably conducted in a fluid bed reactor using the catalyst ac cording to the invention prepared by impregnating a carrier with both reacted and precipitated magnesium being in excess of the number of moles of OH groups in the carrier, and then reacting this impregnated carrier with a titanium compound in molar excess with respect to supported magnesium. This preferred process is most useful when polymers having a density of 0.920 g/cc are required. However, when higher densities are desired, it is possible to employ catalysts in which the only magne 
 sium present is reacted with the carrier (i.e. in the sub stantial absence of precipitated magnesium), and/or where the titanium compound is reacted with the sup ported magnesium composition in a molar ratio of one or less with the magnesium. 
 A fluidized bed reaction system which can be used in the practice of the process of the present invention is 
 illustrated in FIG. 1. With reference thereto the reactor 
 10 consists of a reaction zone 12 and a velocity reduc tion zone 14. 
 The reaction zone 12 comprises a bed of growing polymer particles, formed polymer particles and a minor amount of catalyst particles fluidized by the con tinuous flow of polymerizable and modifying gaseous components in the form of make-up feed and recycle gas through the reaction zone. To maintain a viable fluidized bed, the mass gas flow rate through the bed must be above the minimum flow required for fluidiza tion, and preferably from about 1.5 to about 10 times Gmrand more preferably from about 3 to about 6 times Gnf:Gmfis used in the accepted form as the abbrevia tion for the minimum mass gas flow required to achieve 10

 fluidization, C. Y. Wen and Y. H. Yu, ""Mechanics of Fluidization', Chemical Engineering Progress Sympo 
 sium Series, Vol. 62, p. 100-111 (1966). It is essential that the bed always contains particles to prevent the formation of localized ""hot spots' and to entrap and distribute the particulate catalyst throughout 
 the reaction zone. On start up, the reaction zone is usu ally charged with a base of particulate polymer particles before gas flow is initiated. Such particles may be identi cal in nature to the polymer to be formed or different therefrom. When different, they are withdrawn with the desired formed polymer particles as the first prod uct. Eventually, a fluidized bed of the desired polymer particles supplants the start-up bed. The partially or completely activated catalyst used in 
 the fluidized bed is preferably stored for service in a reservoir 32 under a blanket of a gas which is inert to the stored material, such as nitrogen or argon. Fluidization is achieved by a high rate of gas recycle to and through the bed, typically in the order of about 50 times the rate of feed of make-up gas. The fluidized bed has the general appearance of a dense mass of viable particles in possible free-vortex flow as created by the percolation of gas through the bed. The pressure drop through the bed is equal to or slightly greater than the 
 mass of the bed divided by the cross-sectional area. It is thus dependent on the geometry of the reactor. Make-up gas is fed to the bed at a rate equal to the rate at which particulate polymer product is with drawn. The composition of the make-up gas is deter mined by a gas analyzer 16 positioned above the bed. The gas analyzer determines the composition of the gas being recycled and the composition of the make-up gas is adjusted accordingly to maintain an essentially steady state gaseous composition within the reaction zone. : To insure complete fluidization, the recycle gas and, where desired, part of the make-up gas are returned to the reactor at point 18 below the bed. There exists a gas distribution plate 20 above the point of return to aid fluidizing in the bed. 
 The portion of the gas stream which does not reactin the bed constitutes the recycle gas which is removed from the polymerization zone, preferably by passing it 
 into a velocity reduction zone 14 above the bed where entrained particles are given an opportunity to drop 
 back into the bed. Particle return may be aided by a cyclone 22 which may be part of the velocity reduction zone or exterior thereto. Where desired, the recycle gas may then be passed through a filter 24 designed to re move small particles at high gas flow rates to prevent dust from contacting heat transfer surfaces and com pressor blades. The recycle gas is then compressed in a compressor 25 and then passed through a heat exchanger 26 wherein it is stripped of heat of reaction before it is returned to the bed. By constantly removing heat of reaction, no noticeable temperature gradient appears to exist within the upper portion of the bed. A temperature gradient will exist in the bottom of the bed in a layer of about 6 to 12 inches, between the temperature of the inlet gas and the temperature of the remainder of the bed. Thus, it has been observed that the bed acts to almost immediately adjust the temperature of the recy cle gas above this bottom layer of the bed zone to make it conform to the temperature of the remainder of the bed thereby maintaining itself at an essentially constant temperature under steady state conditions. The recycle 
 is then returned to the reactor at its base 18 and to the 4,481,301 15 
 fluidized bed through distribution plate 20. The com pressor 25 can also be placed upstream of the heat ex changer 26. The distribution plate 20 plays an important role in the operation of the reactor. The fluidized bed contains growing and formed particulate polymer particles as well as catalyst particles. As the polymer particles are hot and possibly active, they must be prevented from settling, for if a quiescent mass is allowed to exist, any active catalyst contained therein may continue to react and cause fusion. Diffusing recycle gas through the bed 
 at a rate sufficient to maintain fluidization at the base of the bed is, therefore, important. The distribution plate 20 serves this purpose and may be a screen, slotted plate, perforated plate, a plate of the bubble cap type, and the like. The elements of the plate may all be sta tionary, or the plate may be of the mobile type disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,298,792. Whatever its design, it must diffuse the recycle gas through the particles at the base of the bed to keep them in a fluidized condition, and also serve to support a quiescent bed of resin particles when the reactor is not in operation. The mobile elements of the plate may be used to dislodge any polymer particles entrapped in or on the plate. Hydrogen may be used as a chain transfer agent in the polymerization reaction of the present invention. The ratio of hydrogen/ethylene employed will vary be tween about 0 to about 2.0 moles of hydrogen per mole 
 of the monomer in the gas stream. Any gas inert to the catalyst and reactants can also be present in the gas stream. The activator compound is preferably added to the reaction system at the hottest portion of the gas which is usually downstream from heat exchanger 26. Thus, the activator may be fed into the gas recycle system from dispenser 27 thru line 27A. Compounds of the structure Zn(Ra)(R), wherein Ra and Rb are the same or different C to C14 aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon radicals, may be used in conjunc tion with hydrogen, with the catalysts of the present invention as molecular weight control or chain transfer agents, that is, to increase the melt index values of the copolymers that are produced. About 0 to 50, and pref. erably about 20 to 30, mols of the Zn compound (as Zn) would be used in the gas stream in the reactor per mol of titanium compound (as Ti) in the reactor. The zinc compound would be introduced into the reactor prefer ably in the form of a dilute solution (2 to 30 weight percent) in hydrocarbon solvent or absorbed on a solid diluent material, such as silica, of the types described above, in amounts of about 10 to 50 weight percent. These compositions tend to be pyrophoric. The zinc compound maybe added alone, or with any additional portions of the activator compound that are to be added to the reactor from a feeder, not shown, which could be positioned adjacent dispenser 27, near the hottest por tion of the gas recycle system. It is essential to operate the fluid bed reactor at a temperature below the sintering temperature of the polymer particles. To insure that sintering will not oc cur, operating temperatures below the sintering temper ature are desired. For the production of ethylene co polymers in the process of the present invention an operating temperature of about 30” to 115 C. is pre ferred, and a temperature of about 75"" to 95°C. is most preferred. Temperatures of about 75° to 90° C. are used to prepare products having a density of about 0.91 to 0.92, and temperatures of about 80' to 100° C. are used to prepare products having a density of about >0.92 to 10

 0.94, and temperatures of about 90 to 115 C. are used to prepare products having a density of about >0.94 to 
 0.96. The fluid bed reactor is operated at pressures of up to about 1000 psi, and is preferably operated at a pressure of from about 150 to 350 psi, with operation at the higher pressures in such ranges favoring heat transfer since an increase in pressure increases the unit volume heat capacity of the gas. The partially or completely activated catalyst in jected into the bed at a rate equal to its consumption at a point 30 which is above the distribution plate 20. In jecting the catalyst at a point above the distribution plate is an important feature of this invention. Since the catalysts used in the practice of this invention are highly active, injection of the fully activated catalyst into the area below the distribution plate may cause polymeriza tion to begin there and eventually cause plugging of the distribution plate. Injection into the viable bed, instead, aids in distributing the catalyst throughout the bed and tends to preclude the formation of localized spots of high catalyst concentration which may result in the formation of ""hot spots"". A gas which is inert to the catalyst such as nitrogen or argon is used to carry the partially or completely reduced precursor composition, and any additional activator compound or non-gaseous chain transfer 
 agent that is needed, into the bed. The production rate of the bed is controlled by the rate of catalyst injection. The production rate may be increased by simply increasing the rate of catalyst injec tion and decreased by reducing the rate of catalyst in jection. Since any change in the rate of catalyst injection will change the rate of generation of the heat of reaction, the temperature of the recycle gas is adjusted upwards or 
 downwards to accommodate the change in rate of heat generation. This insures the maintenance of an essen tially constant temperature in the bed. Complete instru mentation of both the fluidized bed and the recycle gas cooling system is, of course, necessary to detect any temperature change in the bed so as to enable the opera in the temperature of 
 the recycle gas. . . . "" Under a given set of operating conditions, the fluid ized bed is maintained at essentially a constant height by withdrawing a portion of the bed as product at a rate equal to the rate of formation of the particulate polymer product. Since the rate of heat generation is directly related to product formation, a measurement of the temperature rise of the gas across the reactor (the differ ence between inlet gas temperature and exit gas temper ature) is determinative of the rate of particulate polymer formation at a constant gas velocity. The particulate polymer product is preferably contin uously withdrawn at a point 34 at or close to the distri bution plate 20 and in suspension with a portion of the gas stream which is vented before the particulates settle to preclude further polymerization and sintering when the particles reach their ultimate collection zone. The suspending gas may also be used, as mentioned above, to drive the product of one reactor to another reactor. The particulate polymer product is conveniently and preferably withdrawn through the sequential operation of a pair of timed valves 36 and 38 defining a segrega tion zone 40. While valve 38 is closed, valve 36 is opened to emit a plug of gas and product to the zone 40 
 between it and valve 36 which is then closed. Valve 38 4,481,301 17 
 is then opened to deliver the product to an external recovery zone. Valve 38 is then closed to await the next product recovery operation. 
 Finally, the fluidized bed reactor is equipped with an adequate venting system to allow venting the bed dur 
 ing start up and shut down. The reactor does not re quire the use of stirring means and/or wall scraping 
 means. The highly active supported catalyst system of this invention appears to yield a fluid bed product having an average particle size between about 0.005 to about 0.07 inches and preferably about 0.02 to about 0.04 inches. The feed stream of gaseous monomer, with or with out inert gaseous diluents, is fed into the reactor at a space time yield of about 2 to 10 pounds/hour/cubic 
 foot of bed volume. 
 The term virgin resin or polymer as used herein means polymer, in granular form, as it is recovered from the polymerization reactor. Certain of the catalysts of the present invention are capable of producing low density. ethylene/hexene 
 copolymers in a gas phase, fluid bed reactor, which copolymers are capable of being formed into films hav ing especially desirable properties. More particularly, these catalysts are prepared by heating silica at a tem perature of at least 600 C., e.g., from about 750° C. to about 850 C., for a period of time sufficient to remove physically and chemically bound water on the silica to the extent that from about 0.3 to about 0.7 mmoles of OH groups are present per gram of silica. This silica is then slurried in a liquid medium and contacted with from about 1.1 to about 2.5 mmoles of a Grignard rea gent in this liquid medium for a time and temperature sufficient to permit dissolved organomagnesium to react with reactive OH groups on the silica. The liquid is then evaporated, and the resulting dry, free-flowing powder 
 is slurried in another liquid medium to be contacted with a tetravalent titanium compound, the number of moles of this tetravalent titanium compound being in excess of the number of moles of magnesium supported on the silica. For example, this molar ratio of tetravalent titanium to supported magnesium may be from about 3 
 to about 6. Films having especially desirable properties may be formed with the above-mentioned ethylene/hexene copolymers by a variety of techniques. For example, 
 desirable blown films as well as slot cast films may be formed. Blown films formed from ethylene/hexene copoly mers having a density from 0.920 to 0.927 g/cc may have especially desirable properties for bag structures. For example, such blown films may be fabricated into trash bag structures which, when loaded to capacity, resist breaking when dropped from a height of, e.g., four feet. A particular example of a blown film formed from an ethylene/hexene copolymer having a density of 
 0.927 and a melt index of 1 (ASTM D-1238, condition E), which is, in turn, formed in a gas phase, fluid bed reactor with a catalyst according to the present inven 
 tion, is a blown film having a thickness of 1 mil, a dart impact strength of at least 122g, an MD Elmendorf tear strength of at least 164 g/mil, a TD Elmendorf tear strength of at least 665 g/mil, a MD tensile strength of at least 6,400 lbs/in2 and a TD tensile strength of at least 5,400 lbs/in2. Slot cast films formed from low density ethylene/- hexene copolymers having a density of from about 0.916 to about 0.92 may have especially desirable prop 10

 erties as pallet stretch wrap. For example, such stretch wrap may hold loads together and onto pallets and resist breaking when subjected to forces encountered in loading operations where loads are moved about, dropped, etc. A particular example of a slot cast film formed from an ethylene/hexene copolymer having a 
 density of about 0.92 and a melt index of 1.7 (ASTM D-1238, condition E), which is, in turn, formed in a gas phase, fluid bed reactor with a catalyst according to the present invention, is a slot cast film having a thickness of 1 mil, an MD tensile strength of at least about 5,000 lbs/in, an ultimate elongation of at least 500 percent and a TD Elmendorf tear strength of at least 600 g/mil. The following Examples give examples of reactants and parameters which may be used in accordance with aspects of the present invention. 
 EXAMPLE 1. 
 All procedures were carried out in glass or quartz equipment under purified nitrogen using predried nitro 
 gen purged solvents. Davison silica gel, Grade 952, was dehydrated by fluidizing with nitrogen, heating at 200 C. for two hours and cooling to room temperature. This heated 
 silica is believed to contain about 3 mmoles of OH groups per gram of silica. 
 15g of this product was slurried in 200 ml n-hexane. A 2.0 molar solution of ethylmagnesium chloride in tetrahydrofuran (50 ml, 100 mmoles) was added drop wise to the refluxing slurry over approximately 20 min utes, after which time refluxing was continued for a further 30 minutes. The solvents were distilled off, giv ing 29.5g of dry free-flowing powder. 
 15g of this product (50.8 mmoles of Mg) was slurried in a 0.57 Molar solution of TiCl4 in heptane (150ml, 85.5 mmoles) and refluxed for 45 minutes, filtered, the solids washed with three 150 ml portions of hexane and dried under vacuum. The titanium content of this solid cata 
 lyst was 1.39 mmoles/g. 
 Slurry Polymerizations in n-Hexane 
 1. Ethylene, 1-Butene Copolymerization 
 To 1.0 liter of pure dry n-hexane at 30° C. was added a 1.52 M solution of triethylaluminum (1.90 ml, 2.89 mmoles), 1-butene (50 g, 0.89 moles), hydrogen (0.06 moles) and the above catalyst (0.079 g, 0.11 mmoles Ti) giving an Al/Ti ratio of 26. Ethylene addition was begun and polymerization conditions were adjusted to 80' C. and 120 psig total pressure. After 30 minutes, under these conditions, ethylene addition was stopped and the reactor cooled. Upon vacuum drying, a total of 195g of polymer with a melt index (MI, I2) of 53 and a density of 0.9166 g/cc was obtained. 
 2. Ethylene, 1-Hexene Copolymerization 
 The copolymerization was carried out as in 1 using 
 2.4 ml (3.65 mmoles) of TEAL, 91 g 1-hexene (1.08 moles), hydrogen (0.033 moles) and 0.079 g (0.11 mmoles Ti), giving an Al/Tiratio of 33. After drying, a . total of 150 g of polymer with a MI of 3.95 and a density 
 of 0.9187 g/cc was obtained. 
 COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE A 
 Several catalysts prepared substantially in accor 
 dance with the teachings of the Karoletal U.S. Pat. No. 4,302,566, were used in comparative testing as discussed in Examples given hereinafter. These catalysts prepared 4,481,301 19 
 substantially in accordance with this Karol et al patent are referred to herein as ""comparative A' catalysts or simply as 'A' catalysts. The comparative A catalysts are felt to be substan tially equivalent to the catalysts prepared according to 5 
 the Examples of the Karol et al patent. More particu larly, these catalysts are felt to be substantially equiva lent to those prepared by the following representative procedure. 
 In a 5 liter flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, 10 16.0 g (0.168 Mol) of anhydrous MgCl2 is mixed with 850 ml of pure tetrahydrofuran under nitrogen. The mixture is stirred at room temperature (~25 C.) while 13.05 g (0.069 Mol) of TiCl4 is added dropwise. After complete addition, the contents of the flask are heated 15 to reflux for about one-half to one hour to dissolve the 
 solids. The system is cooled to room temperature and 3 liters of pure n-hexane are slowly added over a period of one-half hour. A yellow solid precipitates. The super 
 natant is decanted and the solids are washed with 3X 20 
 one liter of n-hexane. The solids are filtered and dried in a rotating evaporating flask at 40°-60° C. to give 55g of solid precursor composition. The precursor composition may be analyzed at this 20 
 nitrogen line, and overhead stirrer. Under a slow nitro gen purge, 200 ml of dry hexane was added to the silica while stirring. The silica/hexane slurry was brought to reflux temperature and 50 ml of 2.0 M EtMgCL/THF 
 solution was added dropwise (about 15 minutes) and the 
 reflux was continued for an additional 30 minutes. After 
 this time, the solvents were removed by distillation and the silica dried at 80 C. under a nitrogen purge. Total yield, 29 grams; Mg (Theory) 3.45 mmols/gm. 
 Step B: 15 grams of Step A reaction product (51.7 mmols of Mg) were placed into a 500 ml reaction flask (apparatus as described above). 200 ml of n-heptane containing 10.0 
 ml (91 mmols) of TiCl4 was added to the flask while stirring. The slurry was refluxed for 45 minutes. After this time, the slurry was cooled to room temperature, transferred to a filter flask (under nitrogen), filtered, washed with four 100 ml portions of hexane and dried under nitrogen purge; Mg (found) 1.65 mmols/gm, Mg (Theory) 1.67; Ti (found) 1.24 mmols/gm. In addition, for comparison reasons, Example 5 was repeated with the molar ratio of TiCl4 added in Step B to the magnesium present on the silica being less than 1. The resultant catalyst and the processing details are point for Mg and Ti content since some of the Mgand- 25 indicated in Table I as Example 5 (Comparative).

This precursor composition, which constitutes the catalytic portion of the comparative A catalyst, is sup- 55 
 ported on an inert silica carrier and activated in accor dance with the teachings of the Karol et al patent. 
 EXAMPLES 2-7 
 The catalysts of Examples 2-7 were prepared in two 60 steps and the details are summarized in Table I, herein below. The preparation of the catalyst of Example 2 is felt to be representative of the preparation of the cata lysts of Examples 3–7 and is described below: Step A: 65 
 15 grams of Davison silica gel (dried at 200° C. for 4 hours) were placed into a 500 ml 4-neck reaction flask fitted with a dropping funnel, water condensor, dry hexane and about 100 ml of 1-hexene (62.5gms) were added to the autoclave while at ambient temperature. 0.047 gms of catalyst (0.06 mmols of Ti) was slurried into about 50 ml of hexane to which was added suffi 
 cient triethyl aluminum to give an Al/Tiratio of 40. This catalyst slurry was transferred to the reactor using slight nitrogen pressure and 0.03 moles of hydrogen were added by measuring through a calibrated Hoke 
 bomb. The stirring rate was adjusted to 1000 rpm and the temperature control unit set to 80° C. Ethylene pressure 
 was introduced when the autoclave reached 40 C., and the total reactor pressure was adjusted to 115 psi. Polymerizations were continued for 25-35 minutes in order to produce 130-150 grams of polymer. About 400 ppm of Irganox 1076 was added to the polymer/hexane slurry and the hexane was allowed to evaporate under a hood. The products were placed into a vacuum oven overnight at approximately 60' C. to 
 remove residual hexane and monomer. FIG. 2 shows the change in the copolymerization properties of the catalysts of Examples 2-4, as well as comparative A, as measured by resin density at the 1-3 4,481,301 21 I2 melt index level over a range of magnesium loadings into Davison 952 silica dried at 200 C. 
 If silica dried at 800 C, is used in place of silica dried at 200 C., the copolymerization properties of the cata lysts may vary. It is noted that silica dried at 200 C. contains about 6 SiOH groups/100 Angstrom? while silica dried at 800° C. contains only about 1 SiOH group/100 Angstrom. Ethylene/1-butene copolymers were prepared under similar conditions with both comparative A catalyst and the Example 2 catalyst. Table II summarizes the poly merization conditions and product properties of C2/C4 copolymers prepared with A and Example 2 catalysts. 
 Examination of the data in Table II indicates that under similar polymerization conditions the Example 2 cata lyst produced a lower density product than the A cata lyst.

 Examination of FIG. 4 clearly shows that the copoly merization properties of these three catalysts are Exam ple 3 > Example 2 > A. At a 1-hexene to ethylene ratio of about 1.3, the Example 2, Example 3 and A catalysts produced resins with densities of about 0.918 gm/cc, 0.927 gms/cc and 0.935 gms/cc, respectively. The Example 3. catalyst requires about 50 percent 
 (-10 percent) less 1-hexene in the reactor than A cata lyst to produce a LLDPE material with a density of about 0.920 gm/cc. Catalysts were utilized in a two gallon slurry labora tory reactor so that sufficient quantities of polymer 
 (500-800 gms) could be prepared for evaluation. Table IV and FIG. 5 summarize the polymerization condi tions and product properties of ethylene/1-hexene co polymers prepared with catalysts of Examples 3, 5, 6, 7 
 and A. Examination of FIG. 5 suggests that the relative copolymerization properties of these catalysts are (Ex ample 3, Example 5)&Example 6) Example 7d A.

 SO 
 However, at higher hydrogen levels, the Example 2 catalyst products produces a much higher melt index product than A (compare experiments 4 and 3 in Table 
 II). FIG. 3 illustrates the copolymerization differences between the A and Example 2 catalysts. FIG. 3 shows the density versus the butene/ethylene ratio for each of these catalysts. 
 Examination of FIG. 3 suggests that a 0.918 gm/cc LLDPE product requires a C4/C2 ratio of about 2.7 for A catalyst while the Example 2 catalyst requires only a ratio of 1.7. This corresponds to 35 percent less butene in the reactor for the Example 2 catalyst. Table III and FIG. 4 summarize the polymerization conditions and product properties of the ethylene/1- hexene copolymers prepared with A, Example 2 and 3 catalysts in a 1.6 liter slurry reactor. The Example 3 catalyst contains less magnesium and exhibits better 55

Therefore, even in gas phase, fluidized bed arrange ments which cannot optimally accommodate relatively high heat generating catalysts, such as the Example 2 catalyst, such fluidizing bed arrangements may readily accommodate relatively low heat generating catalysts, such as the Example 6 catalyst, without encountering problems of severe temperature gradients, poor opera 
 bility and/or poor bulk density. 
 The data used for FIG. 2 is summarized in Table V as

 The performance of scaled up version of the catalyst of Example 6 (essentially the same as the aforemen tioned version except that the Mg loading in step A is 0.53 mmoles of mg instead of 0.38 mmoles/gl and A catalysts were compared under nearly identical operat 
 ing conditions in a fluidized-bed, pilot reactor. This comparison was accomplished keeping two important operating variables constant, namely temperature, and the molar ratio of hexene to ethylene in the gas phase, and then observing the phYsical properties of the resin product under these comparable conditions. The experiments were done in a pilot-scale fluidized bed reactor which is 18 inches in diameter and capable of producing up to 50 lb/hr of resin. The catalysts used for the comparison were A and the catalyst of Example 6 which was prepared at a pilot plant. The only differ ence between the pilot plant preparation of the catalyst of Example 6 and the laboratory procedure (described 
 earlier) was that a solvent decantation followed by several solvent washes was substituted for the filtration in Step B. Details of the comparison are found in Table VI, and support the slurry reactor findings that the catalyst of Example 6 has significantly improved copo lymerization properties compared to A when run under 
 similar reactor conditions.

 The hexene copolymer samples were extruded into 
 film at standard conditions on a Brabender blown film line. The system comprises a inch extruder feeding a one inch diameter blown film die. The die gap was 0.39 inches. Extrusion rate for all samples was 2.4 lb/hr, at a melt temperature of 185 to 195 C. The film was ex truded at a thickness of 1.5 mils, with a 2:1 blowup ratio and a 2: inch frost line height. All resin samples were stabilized with the same formulation; 700 ppm Kema mine AS 990 to neutralize catalyst residues, 200 ppm Irganox 1010 hindered phenolic antioxidant, and 200 ppm Weston 399 phosphite type peroxide decomposer. Physical properties were then run on the film in the product development laboratory. The values obtained in the laboratory are not in strict accordance with ASTM testing procedures, since the laboratory temper 
 ature and relative humidity are not controlled. The values reported are of merit in an approximate relative sense. Table VII lists the film properties measured on the A and Example 6 catalyzed samples prepared in the fluid bed pilot plant. MD tear strength is a measure of the resistance of the film to the propagation of a tear 
 initiated in the machine direction of the film. TD tear 
 measures the resistance of the film to the propagation of a tear initiated in the transverse direction of the film. Impact strength measures the amount of energy ab sorbed during a high speed puncture of the film. These tests are felt to be of significant value in the ranking of relative toughness.

 The improvement in properties of the Example 6 catalyzed hexene copolymers is due essentially to the improved comonomer incorporation, which results in a significantly lower density at the same reactor condi 
 tions. It can easily be seen from the data in Table VII that the Example 6 catalyzed samples (produced at reactor 
 conditions which bracket those of the A catalyzed sam plesl are much tougher in these tests than the A cata lyzed samples. Impact strength of the Example 6 cata lyzed samples is nearly double that of the A catalyzed samples. TD tear strength is more than 2.5 times that of the A samples, and MD tear strength averages more 
 than 3 times that of the A samples. The melt indices of these samples were all similar, between 1.3 and 1.7. Head pressure readings indicate that the processability of the A and Example 6 resins are essentially the same. 4,481,301 25 
 COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE B 
 The catalyst of this Comparative Example was pre pared in accordance with Example 7 of the Yamaguchi 
 et al U.S. Pat. No. 3,989,881. One will readily note the similarities between this comparative Example B cata lyst composition and the catalytically active precursor composition described in the Karol et al U.S. Pat. No. 4,302,566, e.g., exemplified in the passage extending 
 from line 65 of column 14 to line 26 of column 15. The particular procedure used to prepare the catalyst of comparative Example B is as follows. 15 g (158 mmol) of anhydrous magnesium chloride, MgCl2, was slurried in 530 ml dry tetrahydrofuran 
 (THF) in a one liter 3-necked round-bottomed flask fitted with a magnetic stirrer. 10 g (52.7 mmol) of TiCl4 were added dropwise while heating. The mixture was refluxed for approximately 
 one hour, by which time all solids had dissolved. After cooling, 275 ml hexane were added dropwise at 5 ml/minute to precipitate the solids. The mother-liquors 
 were decanted and the solid washed with two 200 ml 
 portions of hexane by decantation, and dried. The yel low solid contained 3.08 mmol Mg and 0.95 mmol Ti/g catalyst.

 dried at approximately 80 C. under a nitrogen purge. 
 15g of this product was slurried in 45.5 mmols of TiCl4 dissolved in 200 ml n-heptane, and the slurry refluxed for 45 minutes, using the same apparatus as described 
 above. The mixture was allowed to cool to room tem 
 perature, transferred to a filter flask under N2 and fil 
 tered. The solids were washed with three to four 
 100-150 ml portions of hexane and dried under a nitro gen purge. A free flowing yellow powder was obtained. Analyses for Ti and Mg are given in Table VIII. 
 COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE C 
 A catalyst was prepared in substantially the same 
 manner as described for Examples 8 and 9 except that the silica support was omitted. Further details are given 
 in Table VIII. It is noted that the formation of a small 
 amount of precipitate as evidenced by cloudiness was noticed as Grignard was added to hexane. This observa tion would have been masked if silica were present as a hexane slurry. 
 EXAMPLES 10-11 
 Catalysts prepared in the pilot plant were scaled up directly from laboratory preparations, except that de 
 cantation had to be used to wash the final catalyst rather than filtration, as described above Further preparation details are given in Table VIII.

 All procedures were carried out in glass or quartz equipment under purified nitrogen using predried nitro

 VIII, was introduced into a 500 ml 4-necked round-bot 
 tomed flask fitted with a stirrer, thermometer, addition funnel, dry nitrogen line and a distillation head to re move solvent. The flask was placed in an oil bath main tained at a controlled temperature. 250 ml hexane was added to the silica while stirring under a slow nitrogen purge. The silica/hexane slurry was brought to reflux temperature and a 2.0 M solution of ethylmagnesium chloride in THF added dropwise 
 over 5-15 minutes. The reflux was continued for an 
 additional 30-40 minutes. After a total of 45 minutes the

The catalyst was activated in a catalyst addition flask by adding an amount of 25 weight percent triethylaluminum in hex ane to a given weight of catalyst suspended in 50 ml of dry hexane. Amounts used are given in Tables IX and X. The mixture was pressured into the reactor using nitrogen and the total reactor pressure adjusted to 20 psig with hydrogen. The reactor was heated at 3 C./minute with a set-point at 80 C. Ethylene was intro duced at 60° C. so as to maintain total operating pres sure at 120 psig, Polymerizations were carried out for approximately one hour, giving 450-950 g of polymer.

 ZEGLER-NATTA CATALYST AND METHOD FOR 
 MAKING AND USING SAME 
 FIELD OF THE INVENTION 
 0001. The present invention relates to catalysts, and par ticularly to Ziegler-Natta catalysts and to a method for making and using catalysts in polymerization reactions. 
 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 
 0002 Ziegler-Natta catalysts are advantageously used in 
 olefin polymerization reactions to produce Stereoregulated 
 linear polymers. It is known that Ziegler-Natta catalysts may 
 be formed by coating a Silica Support material with a magnesium-halide compound, a transition metal compound, electron donor compound(s) and an organo-aluminum 
 cocatalyst. The transition metal is an active catalytic ingre dient and the magnesium-halide compound may also be 
 thought of as being active to the extent that it acts as a Synergist to increase the overall catalytic productivity of the 
 transition metal. The electron donor compounds and organo 
 aluminum cocatalyst are important because they enable the Ziegler-Natta catalyst to catalyze polymerization of isotactic 
 polymers. The Silica material is inactive and does not increase polymerization reaction rates. 
 0003. It is known that silica-based Ziegler-Natta catalysts may be produced from high-porosity Silica particles in the 
 diameter range of about 10-100 microns, which may be coated with 1 or more relatively thin layers of a magnesium halide compound to form a catalyst Support, which may be 
 treated with a transition metal to form a catalyst. However, this type of catalyst generally comprises a high ratio of 
 inactive Silica relative to the active ingredients. Further, the catalyst Supports may need to be mechanically treated to produce generally Spherical, or spheroidal, catalyst Supports 
 of the appropriate diameter and particle diameter distribu tion, which will form catalyst particles of the appropriate 
 diameter and particle diameter distribution and, thus, will facilitate efficient polymerization reactions. 
 0004 U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,293,673 and 4,376,062, both to Hamer et al., disclose methods for forming Silica based catalysts with very Small Silica particles, no larger than about 
 0.05 micron, which are mixed in a slurry to form solid agglomerations comprising a number of Silica particles 
 mixed with active ingredients. While Hamer utilizes silica particles which are very Small, the resulting catalysts Still 
 comprise at least 10 wt % inert silica material. This is 
 undesirable because the higher the relative amount of inert Silica material the lower the Overall activity of the catalyst, and the higher the amount of catalyst residues in a polymer 
 formed therewith. Thus, the production costs of the polymer, per weight unit of catalyst, is higher for catalysts containing 
 relatively large amounts of inert material. Further, higher amounts of catalyst residues may detrimentally affect poly mer processing and/or the physical properties of products 
 made with the polymer. 
 0005 Thus, there is a need for an efficient and reliable method for producing catalyst Support materials, and ulti mately catalysts, which comprise a relatively Small percent 
 age of inactive materials, and which have a relatively Smooth spherical or spheroidal shape and Suitable average 
 particle diameter and particle diameter distribution. Mar. 2, 2006 
 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 
 0006 The invention comprises a method for making magnesium-halide Supports of a Specified particle shape, 
 average diameter and particle diameter distribution, which comprises providing a non-aqueous Solution of a magne 
 sium-halide containing Silica particles dispersed therein, and crystallizing the magnesium-halide about the Silica particles 
 to provide the magnesium-halide Support, wherein the Sup port has an approximately spherical shape, an average 
 particle diameter from about 10 to about 120 microns, and a particle diameter distribution from about 10 to about 150 
 microns. The invention further comprises methods for mak ing catalysts and using Same in polymerization reactions. 
 The invention further comprises catalyst Supports and cata lysts. 
 0007 Catalysts of the invention may include transition metal compounds, organo-aluminum co-catalysts and/or 
 electron donors and may be useful for the polymerization of olefins to provide polymers having good morphology and 
 bulk density.

 DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED 
 EMBODIMENTS 
 0011. The present invention generally concerns Ziegler Natta catalysts and processes for making and using Same, 
 which may include coating a Silica Support material, acting as a Seeding agent, with a magnesium compound to form a 
 Solid catalyst Support. The catalyst Support may be reacted 
 with a transition metal, an internal electron donor, an organo-aluminum co-catalyst and an external electron donor 
 to form a catalyst Suitable for, for example, various poly 
 merization reactions. 
 0012. In a preferred process, a Silica Seeding agent is 
 dispersed in a non-polar, non-ionic oil, for example, mineral 
 oil, paraffin oil or Silicone oil, in a mixing apparatus Such as a simple paddle Stirrer operating at a few hundred rpms or 
 a Ultra-Turrax(RT 50 Homogenizer with stirring speeds up to 10,000 rpms. Preferably, the ratio of silica seeding agent 
 to oil is in the range of about 0.25 grams per liter to about 25.0 grams per liter, more preferably about 1.0 gram per liter 
 to about 10.0 grams per liter. The Silica Seeding agent is 
 described in more detail below. 
 0013 Anhydrous magnesium halide compound can be 
 added to the dispersion of silica in oil, followed by addition 
 of an alkanol Solvent Such as anhydrous ethanol, methanol, or 2-ethyl-1-hexanol. Alternatively, anhydrous ethanol, 
 methanol or 2-ethyl-1-hexanol can be added to an anhydrous 
 (i.e., less than about 0.5 wt % HO) magnesium-halide compound to form a Soluble complex, as described below. 
 About 0.01 wt % to about 10.0 wt %, more preferably from 
 about 0.1 wt % to about 5.0 wt %, and still more preferably US 2006/0046928A1 
 from about 0.5 wt % to about 3.0 wt % of the silica seeding agent is used relative to the magnesium-halide compound. 
 Generally, a higher ratio of magnesium-halide to Silica 
 Seeding agent in the mixture results in a higher ratio of magnesium-halide to Silica in the catalyst Support formed and, consequently, a larger catalyst Support is expected to 
 form because more magnesium-halide crystalizes onto the Silica Seeding agent. 
 0.014. The solvent is added in amounts from about 2 to 20 times, preferably about 6 times, the molar ratio of the magnesium-halide compound to facilitate the liquefying of 
 the magnesium-halide compound at a lower temperature. 
 U.S. Pat. No. 4,421,674 to Invernizzi et al. teaches, for 
 example, that when the mole ratio of ethanol (“EtOH') to MgCl, is 102, the complex liquefies at 60° C.; at a mole ratio of EtOH to MgCl2 of 7.75 the complex liquefies at 80° C.; 
 at a mole ratio of EtOH to MgCl, of 6.51 the complex liquefies at 90° C.; and at a mole ratio of EtOH to MgCl, of 5.43 the complex liquefies at 100° C. The mixture is initially translucent due to the Suspension of the magnesium-halide 
 compound and the Silica Seeding agent. The mixture is 
 heated to about 60° C. to about 140°C., preferably about 80° 
 C. to about 120° C., until the solvent begins to reflux and the magnesium-halide compound goes into Solution, whereupon 
 the mixture becomes transparent, and the temperature is 
 maintained at the reflux temperature for about 0.25 hours to about 3.0 hours, preferably about 1.0 hour to about 2.0 hours, preferably with continuous stirring. It is possible to 
 form the mixture without either the oil or the Solvent, or by mixing the ingredients in a different order, but the above 
 described mixing operation has been shown to result in a well-dispersed mixture. 
 0015 The clear mixture, which includes a MgCl2.xEtOH complex (where X is an integer from 1-20), is rapidly transferred to a Second mixing apparatus containing a pre 
 chilled hydrocarbon Solvent, Such as heptane, hexane, cyclo hexane, or other aliphatic or cycloaliphatic hydrocarbon 
 which is miscible in the oil and which will not freeze at the 
 temperatures necessary for the Solidification of the MgCl2.xEtOH complex. The hydrocarbon solvent is pre 
 chilled, for example, to between ice (0° C.) and dry ice/ isopropanol temperatures (i.e., about -70° C. to -90° C.). The rapid temperature decrease causes almost all of the magnesium-halide compound to precipitate out of Solution 
 and crystallize onto the Silica Seeding agent, thus coating the Silica Seeding agent to form a catalyst Support. The catalyst 
 Support particles preferably include less than 10 wt % Silica, 
 preferably no more than 5 wt % silica, and more preferably 
 no more than 3 wt % Silica. 
 0016. After about 0.5 to 2 hours, preferably about 1 hour, 
 the mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature and it is filtered. Approximately Spherical and/or Spheroidal Solid 
 catalyst Support particles, each comprising at least one Silica Seeding agent with magnesium-halide crystals attached 
 thereto, are collected and washed Several times with more hydrocarbon Solvent, until the hydrocarbon Solvent appears 
 to be colorless, and are dried (e.g., vacuum dried) in a rotary evaporator at about 40 C. to 80 C., preferably at about 60 
 C., for 1 to 3 hours, preferably for about 2 hours. The term “approximately Spherical' or “approximately Spheroidal' 
 means that all points on the Surface of the particle are within 
 the range of radius r to 2r wherein r is the minimum radial 
 distance between the center of the particle and the closest Mar. 2, 2006 
 point thereto on the Surface of the particle. The magnesium halide compound may alternately be crystallized onto the 
 Silica Seeding agent with known Spray drying techniqueS or 
 by gradually evaporating the Solvent in which it was origi 
 nally dissolved. 
 0017 Next, the catalyst support is slowly added to about 
 10 to 50 moles of a transition metal compound for each mole of magnesium in the magnesium-halide compound at about 
 -30 to 50 C., and the temperature of this mixture is raised 
 to about 20 to 80°C., preferably about 30-60° C. An internal electron donor is added and the temperature is raised, generally with stirring, to about 80 to 130 C., preferably 
 100-110° C., and is kept at that level for about 1 to 3 hours, preferably about 2 hours. 
 0018. The internal electron donor compound, in general, 
 is used in an amount from about 0.05 to about 2.0 moles, 
 preferably about 0.1 to about 0.5 mole, for each mole of magnesium in the magnesium-halide compound. 
 0019. The result is a mixture comprising solid catalyst 
 particles and unreacted transition metal compound and inter 
 nal electron donor compound. 
 0020. The solid catalyst particles are filtered out and, 
 preferably, extracted for about 1 to 3 hours, preferably about 
 2 hours, at about 110 to 140 C., more preferably about 125 C. with a mixture of transition metal compound (about 5 to 30 wt %, preferably about 10 wt %), and an inert solvent, Such as a C-C alkylbenzene, preferably ethylbenzene 
 (about 70 to 85 wt %, preferably about 90 wt %) in a known “Soxhlet” extraction type arrangement. This extraction treat ment enhances catalyst activity and Stereospecificity. Alter 
 natively, the Solid catalyst may receive any number of other 
 known extraction treatments, which may, but need not, include a transition metal treatment. Alternatively, the cata lyst could simply be boiled in a Solution comprising a 
 transition metal compound with or without an inert Solvent, 
 i.e., a Solvent which will not react with the transition metal 
 compound. U.S. Pat. No. 4,745,164 to Schweier et al. and 
 U.S. Pat. No. 6,034,023 to Kersting et al., which are incor porated by reference herein, teach examples of extraction 
 methods which may be utilized in the present invention. 
 0021. The Solid catalyst may be recovered by filtration, 
 washed with an inert Solvent, Such as heptane, hexane, cyclohexane or other aliphatic or cycloaliphatic hydrocar 
 bon, dried by draining off transition metal compound and 
 Solvent, washed a Second time with the inert Solvent, and 
 dried. 
 0022. The solid catalyst Support particles and/or catalyst 
 particles preferably comprise about 0.01 wt % to about 10 wt 
 % silica, more preferably about 0.1 wt % to about 5 wt % 
 Silica. 
 0023 The solid catalyst Support particles and/or catalyst particles preferably have a weight percent ratio of Silica to 
 magnesium-halide compound in the range of about 1:20 to 
 1:3, preferably from about 1:10 to 1:4. 
 0024. The catalyst may preferably be treated with an organo-aluminum co-catalyst and an external electron donor or other Stereoregulating agent to form a Ziegler-Natta 
 catalyst, which may be used, for example, in polymerization 
 reactions. Examples of external electron donor compounds 
 which may be used in the catalytic System of the invention US 2006/0046928A1 
 include mono- and polyfunctional carboxylic acids, car boxylic anhydrides and carboxylic esters, and ketones, 
 ethers, alcohols, lactones as well as organic phosphorus and 
 Silicon compounds. Also, a mixture of two or more external 
 electron donor compounds can be used. The external elec 
 tron donor compound and the internal electron donor com pound used in the preparation of the Solid catalyst compo 
 nent may be the same or different. Preferred external electron donor compounds are disclosed below. 
 0.025 In such cases the organo-aluminum co-catalyst and 
 the external electron donor may be contacted with the Solid catalyst Separately, in any order, or together, preferably at a 
 temperature from about 0 to 200 C., more preferably from 
 about 20 to 90° C., and preferably at a pressure of about 1 
 to 100 bar, more preferably from about 1 to 40 bar. 
 0.026 Preferably, the organo-aluminum co-catalyst is 
 added in Such an amount that the molar ratio of the alumi 
 num co-catalyst to the transition metal in the Solid catalyst 
 is from about 10:1 to about 800:1, more preferably from 
 about 20:1 to about 200:1. 
 0027. The external electron donor is used with the cata lyst in amounts ranging from about 1 to 100 moles, prefer 
 ably 10 to 30 moles, for each mole of transition metal in the catalyst. Generally, it is highly preferred that an external 
 electron donor, with or without the organo-aluminum co 
 catalyst, be used in order to maintain a high level of Stereospecificity in polymers produced with the catalysts of 
 the invention. 
 0028. A preferred silica seeding agent is a microspheroi 
 dal silica (SiO2), for example, a fumed Silica Such as CAB-O-SIL(R-5 (Cabot Corporation; Midland, Mich.). Other Silica Seeding agents may include, for example, Aero 
 sile) fumed silica, available from USA Midwest Degussa Corporation, 3500 Embassy Parkway Ste. 100, Akron Ohio 
 4.4333. 
 0029. The silica seeding agent is characterized by its relatively Small average particle diameter, i.e., preferably 
 about 0.005-10 microns, more preferably about 0.001-5.0 microns, most preferably from about 0.01 microns to about 1.0 micron. The Silica Seeding agent has low porosity 
 because of its lack of, or Small quantity of, pores. That is, it 
 has a porosity of less than about 0.5 cc/gram as measured by nitrogen adsorption, which indicates that the Silica particles 
 have relatively Smooth Surfaces. The Silica Seeding agent particles have relatively uniform spherical or spheroidal shape, i.e., approximately Spherical shape, and preferably 
 having a radius which does not vary by more than about 20% from the center to any point on the Surface of the particle. The particles of the Silica Seeding agent have a relatively 
 small particle diameter distribution, such that 50% of the Silica particles have particle diameters ranging from about 
 0.05 microns to about 0.5 microns. 
 0030 The small particle diameter of the silica seeding agent is significant because the resulting catalyst will ulti mately comprise a relatively Small percentage, i.e., less than 
 10 wt %, of inert silica material as compared to the total weight of the catalyst Support. Thus, the catalyst will operate 
 more efficiently because a relatively larger portion of the 
 Solid catalyst will comprise active catalytic material, i.e., the transition metal and the magnesium-halide Synergist. In preferred catalyst Supports the Silica component will be leSS Mar. 2, 2006 
 than 10 wt % of the total catalyst Support weight, more 
 preferably about 0.1 wt % to about 5 wt %, and yet more 
 preferably about 0.5 wt % to about 3.0 wt % of the catalyst Support formed by the above-described processes. Since the Silica Seeding agent provides a Surface upon which the magnesium-halide compound will crystallize, the Smooth 
 approximately spherical shape and Small particle diameter 
 distribution of the Silica Seeding agent will result in catalyst Support particles, and ultimately catalyst particles, with a 
 relatively Smooth approximately spherical shape and Small 
 particle diameter distribution. These qualities will contribute to an efficient polymerization process with a relatively Small 
 amount of fines in polymers produced in reactions con 
 ducted with the catalysts of the invention. This is an advan tage over other catalysts which, for example, may need to undergo various complex and expensive processes in order to acquire an approximately Spherical shape and/or accept 
 able particle diameter and particle diameter distribution. 
 0031. The diameters of the catalyst support particles will 
 range from about 5-150 microns, more preferably from 
 about 20-60 microns, most preferably from about 20-40 microns. The particle size distribution of the catalyst Support particles is Such that 50% of the catalyst Support particles 
 have particle diameters ranging from about 20 microns to 
 about 60 microns. 
 0032. The catalyst particles will have diameters which are about 20%-50% smaller. For example, a support particle 
 with a 70 micron diameter may result in a catalyst particle 
 with a 50-60 micron diameter. The reason for this reduction 
 in Size is as follows. It is generally known that ethanol dissolves the MgCl2 by first Swelling the structure of the solid MgCl. (MgCl2 has a layered structure. Ethanol occu pies the interstitial spaces between the MgCl2 layers.) AS 
 more alcohol is added and/or the material is heated, this Structure continues to Swell or expand until the MgCl, layers Segregate and the MgCloEtOH complex becomes a liquid. 
 When this complex is reacted with TiCl, the removal of 
 ethanol causes the Structure and thus the particle to Shrink or diminish in size. Thus, the catalyst Supports and catalysts of 
 the invention are notable for having relatively thick layers of active ingredients, referring to both the Synergistic magne 
 sium-halide layer and active transition metal layer, on rela tively Small Silica particles. Again, this results in the overall percentage of inactive Silica delivered to a polymerization 
 reactor to be lower than in other known processes. Conse quently, overall efficiency in the polymerization reactor will be higher. 
 0033 Preferably, catalyst Support particles and catalyst 
 particles of the invention will each include one Silica Seed particle, or a Small group of Silica Seed particles comprising 
 less than 10% of the total catalyst Support weight. In contrast 
 to the present invention, other known catalysts typically comprise relatively large Silica particles or agglomerations 
 of a number of very Small Silica particles within each catalyst Support particle Such that there is a relatively larger 
 amount (e.g., up to 50 wt %) of inert Silica in the catalyst particle. 
 0034. The magnesium compound is an inorganic solid 
 magnesium-halide compound containing at least one halo 
 gen atom, Such as magnesium chloride, magnesium bromide 
 and magnesium iodide, as well as mixed halogen oxides or hydroxides like chloromagnesium hydroxide, bromomagne US 2006/0046928A1 
 sium hydroxide and iodomagnesium hydroxide. Among 
 these compounds the magnesium dihalides corresponding to 
 the formula MgX are preferred wherein X is a halogen. Especially preferred is magnesium chloride (MgCl). Pref 
 erably, the inorganic Solid magnesium-halide compound is 
 in a Substantially anhydrous condition. 
 0.035 Transition metal compounds for treating the cata 
 lyst Support are preferably titanium or Vanadium com 
 pounds. Titanium compounds useful in preparing the Solid 
 catalyst component include the halogenides of tri- or tet 
 ravalent titanium. Titanium alkoxy halogenide compounds 
 and mixtures of two or more titanium compounds are also contemplated. Examples of Suitable titanium compounds 
 include TiBr, TiBri, TiCl, TiCl, Ti(OCH)Cl. Ti(OCH3)Cls, Ti(O-iso-CH2)C1, Ti(O-n-CHg)Cls, 
 Ti(OCH)Br, Ti(O-n-CH-)Br, Ti(OCH) Cl, 
 Ti(OCH3)Cl., Ti(O-n-CH3)2Cl2, Ti(OCH3)Br, 
 Ti(OCH) Cl, Ti(OCH) Cl, Ti(O-n-CHo). Cl, Ti(OCH), Br, Ti(OCH), Ti(OCH), or Ti(O-n-CHo). 
 Preferred titanium compounds include those wherein the 
 halogen is chlorine. Also preferred are those titanium halo 
 genides that in addition to the titanium contain only halogen, 
 and of these the titanium chlorides, and in particular titanium 
 tetrachloride, are preferred. 
 0.036 Vanadium compounds useful in the preparation of 
 the Solid catalytic component of the catalytic System 
 described herein include the Vanadium halogenides, the 
 Vanadium oxyhalogenides, the Vanadium alkoxides and 
 Vanadium acetylacetonate. Preferred Vanadium compounds 
 are those having oxidation Stages 3 to 5. 
 0037. The function of the internal and external electron 
 donors, e.g., Lewis bases, is two-fold. One function is to block “coordinately unsaturated' Sites on the magnesium 
 compound So that the active site, the transition metal com 
 pound, will not attach to those Sites. The other function is to 
 reduce the “coordinately unsaturated” environment around 
 the bound active site in order to improve its Stereospecificity. 
 Both results are the Same, i.e. the electron donors improve the isotacticity or Stereoregularity of polymers produced 
 with the catalyst. The reason for this is that a “coordinately 
 unsaturated' Site has a lower energy barrier for binding 
 propylene in various configurations, i.e., it can bond to 
 propylene in multiple ways, leading to a reduction in poly 
 mer isotacticity and Subsequently lower polymer crystallin 
 ity. Lower polymer crystallinity results in lower polymer melting points and increased hydrocarbon (e.g., xylene, 
 decalin, or heptane) Solubles. A “coordinatively Saturated” Site will predominately bond to the active site in only one way. As a result, a coordinatively Saturated Site produces 
 uniform or isotactic polypropylene. 
 0.038 Internal electron donor compounds which may be used in the preparation of the Solid catalytic component 
 include, at least, mono or polyfunctional carboxylic acids, carboxylic anhydrides, or carboxylic esters, and also 
 ketones, ethers, alcohols, lactones or organophosphorous or organosilicon compounds. 
 0.039 Preferred internal electron donor compounds included carboxylic acid derivatives and, in particular, phthalic acid derivatives having the general formula (I): Mar. 2, 2006 
 (I) 
 wherein X and Y each represent a chlorine or bromine atom or a C-Co alkoxy group, or X and Y taken together represent an oxygen atom forming an anhydride function. 
 Particularly preferred internal electron donor compounds are 
 phthalic esters of formula (I) wherein X and Y each are a C-Cs alkoxy group, such as a methoxy, ethoxy, n-propyloxy, isopropyloxy, n-butyloxy, Sec-butyloxy, or tert-butyloxy 
 group. Examples of preferred phthalic esters include diethyl phthalate, di-n-butyl phthalate, di-isobutyl phthalate, di-n- pentyl phthalate, di-n-hexyl phthalate, di-n-heptyl phthalate, 
 di-n-octyl phthalate or di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate. 
 0040. Further examples of preferred internal electron 
 donor compounds include diesters of 3- or 4-membered, optionally Substituted cycloalkane 1,2-dicarboxylic acids, as 
 well as monoesters of Substituted benzophenone 2-carboxy 
 lic acids or Substituted benzophenone 3-carboxylic acids. AS hydroxy compounds in the esterfication reaction for synthe 
 sis of these esters, alkanols Such as C-C or Cs-C7 cycloal kanols (optionally Substituted with one or more C-C alkyl groups), as well as C-Co phenols, can be used. A particu larly preferred internal electron donor is di-alkyl carboxylic 
 acid ester. 
 0041. A further group of suitable internal electron donor compounds are the non-Substituted and Substituted (C-Co alkyl)-1,3-propane diethers and derivatives of the group of 
 Succinates. 
 0042. Also, mixtures of two or more internal electron donor compounds may be used in the preparation of the Solid catalytic component of the invention. 
 0043. Examples of external electron donor compounds 
 which may be used in the catalytic System of the invention include mono- and polyfunctional carboxylic acids, car 
 boxylic anhydrides and carboxylic esters, and ketones, 
 ethers, alcohols, lactones as well as organic phosphorus and 
 Silicon compounds. Also, a mixture of two or more external electron donor compounds can be used. The external elec 
 tron donor compound and the internal electron donor com pound used in the preparation of the Solid catalyst compo 
 nent may be the same or different. However, it is generally 
 preferred that the internal and external electron donors be 
 different because the desired internal electron donor is one 
 which will block sites that lead to “coordinative unsatura 
 tion” or that transform “coordinatively unsaturated” sites 
 into “coordinatively Saturated' Sites. And yet these internal 
 electron donors do not react with TiCl. In the case of 
 external electron donors, the desired molecule is one that 
 will have the same affect on “coordinative Saturation', but will not react with the aluminum alkyl cocatalyst. A mol 
 ecule that yields “coordinative unsaturation” yet does not 
 react with either TiCl, and AlR would be ideal. However, US 2006/0046928A1 
 due to the difficulty in finding Such a Single Substance, most polypropylene catalysts employ two separate Substances for 
 their internal and external electron donors. 
 0044 Preferred external electron donor compounds include the organosilicon compounds of the general formula 
 (II): 
 R""Si(OR), (II) 
 0045 wherein each R' may be the same or different and represents a C-Coalkyl group, a 5- to 7-membered cyclic 
 alkyl group optionally Substituted with C-C alkyl, a C-C1s aryl group or a Co-C1s aryl-C-Cio alkyl group; and each R may be the same or different and represents a C-Coalkyl group; and n is an integer equal to 1, 2 or 3. 
 0046 Preferred compounds of formula (II) are diisopro pyldimethoxysilane, isobutylisopropyl-dimethoxysilane, 
 disobutyldimethoxysilane, dicyclopentyl-dimethoxysilane, cyclohexylmethyldimethoxysilane, dicyclohexyldimethoX 
 ySilane, isopropyl-tert-butyldimethoxysilane, isopropyl-Sec 
 butyldimethoxysilane, and isobutyl-Sec-butyldimethoxysi 
 lane. 
 0047. Other stereoregulating agents which may be sub

 0049 Polymerization is initiated by formation of a metal 
 carbon bond (Ti-C). The function of the aluminum alkyl is to alkylate the TiCl. This can be accomplished in a variety 
 of ways: by addition of aluminum alkyl to the reactor Separate from the catalyst, by premixing the aluminum alkyl 
 with the catalyst prior to addition to the reactor, or by 
 premixing of the aluminum alkyl and external electron donor prior to mixing with the catalyst. 
 0050 Examples of Suitable organo-aluminum co-cata 
 lysts include aluminum trialkyls (AIR) and derivatives thereof wherein an alkyl group is Substituted by an alkoxy 
 group or a halogen atom, e.g. chlorine or bromine atom. The alkyl groups may be the same or different. The alkyl groups 
 may be linear or branched chain alkyl groups. Preferred trialkylaluminum compounds are those wherein the alkyl 
 groups each have 1 to 8 C-atoms, Such as trimethylalumi num, triethylaluminum, tri-isobutylaluminum, trioctylalu 
 minum or methyldiethyl aluminum. 
 0051. The equipment used in the processes of the inven 
 tion are well known in the art and, generally, may be 
 substituted for by those familiar with catalysts and their production. Reactor Systems can include high pressure, 
 Stainless Steel vessels, low preSSure, glass vessels, CSTR 
 vessels, loop reactors, Vertical Stirred-bed gas phase reac 
 tors, horizontal Stirred-bed gas phase reactors, Vertical, 
 fluid-bed gas phase reactors, and the like. 
 0052 The catalysts of the present invention were tested for polymerization performance using a 2-liter, jacketed, 
 stainless steel reactor available from Pressure Products 
 Industries, Inc., 900 Louis Drive, Warminster, Pa. 18974. Liquid propylene was metered in using a high preSSure Site-glass. Hydrogen was added by measuring the preSSure 
 differential across a 300 ml vessel. 
 0053 A test sample of a preferred catalyst of the inven 
 tion was prepared and tested as follows: 
 Catalyst Preparation Procedure 
 0054) 50 milligrams of CAB-O-SIL(R) was dispersed in 
 about 250 ml of mineral oil in a flask by stirring. Subse quently, 10 grams of anhydrous MgCl, followed by 6 equivalents of anhydrous ethanol (per equivalent of magne 
 sium) was added. The mixture was heated until the ethanol began to reflux. The mixture was maintained at this tem perature for about 1 hour with continuous Stirring. 
 0055. The contents of the flask were then rapidly trans ferred to a Second flask containing 1 liter of heptane pre chilled to dry icefisopropanol temperatures. After an hour 
 the temperature of the contents of the Second flask were 
 allowed to warm to room temperature and were then filtered. Approximately Spherical Solid catalyst Support particles 
 were collected and washed Several times with heptane, until the Washings appeared to be colorleSS, and then Vacuum dried in a rotary evaporator at 60° C. for about 2 hours. US 2006/0046928A1 
 0056 Next, the solid catalyst Support particles were 
 added slowly to a third flask containing 200 ml of neat TiCl, 
 which had been pre-cooled to about 0° C. After the tem perature was raised to about 50-60 C., 1.5 ml of di-n- butylphthalate, a di-alkylcarboxylic acid ester, as an internal 
 electron donor, was added. The contents of the third flask were heated to 100-110° C. and held at that temperature for 
 about 2 hours. 
 0057 The heat was removed, and solid catalyst particles 
 and liquid from the third flask were transferred to a Soxlet extractor. The liquid, which comprised unreacted TiCl, and 
 internal electron donor compound, was removed by filtering through a porous Sintered glass filter that is part of the 
 reaction vessel. The remaining Solid catalyst particles were 
 then extracted for about two hours at 125 C. with a mixture 
 of 90% ethylbenzene and 10% TiCl. This TiCl, treatment greatly enhances the performance of the catalyst. 
 0.058 At the conclusion of the extraction, the Solid cata lyst particles were dried by draining off residual TiCland ethylbenzene, Washing with heptane, and vacuum drying. 
 The polymerization productivity of the catalyst was then 
 tested using the general polymerization procedure described 
 below. 
 Polymerization Testing Procedure 
 0059) A quantity of 4 ml of 25 wt % triethylaluminum 
 (TEAl) was added to a leg of a two-leg stainless Steel injector, along with 2 ml of a 0.1 molar Solution of cyclo hexylmethyl dimethoxysilane, as an external electron donor. 
 The aluminum alkyl activates the catalyst by replacing one 
 of the chlorides on the titanium with an alkyl group. There after, alkylation can propagate continued insertion of pro pylene groups during a polymerization reaction. The exter 
 nal electron donor is important for controlling the nature of the propylene insertion, but it is not necessary for Starting or maintaining propylene insertion. 
 0060 20 Milligrams of a mixture containing 2 parts anhydrous MgCl2 and 1 part of the experimental catalyst 
 prepared above was added to another leg of the injector. The experimental catalyst was diluted in this manner to facilitate 
 more accurate measurement of Small quantities of catalyst 
 tested in this example. The injector was then attached to the 
 reactor So that the contents of the injector legs could be charged to the reactor under inert atmospheric conditions. 
 0061 A polymerization reaction vessel comprising a 2-li 
 ter, Stainless Steel, jacketed pressure vessel, was purged of 
 moisture and oxygen by heating to at least 100° C. while a 
 Slow bleed of dry nitrogen was maintained through the 
 vessel. The TEAl and external electron donor were added to 
 the reactor by flushing the appropriate injector leg with 
 600-800 ml of propylene. The catalyst was then added in a 
 similar fashion by flushing the other leg of the injector with 200-400 ml of liquid propylene. 100 delta-psig (as measured 
 across a 300 ml vessel) of hydrogen was added to the reactor. 
 The vessel was sealed and heated to about 70° C. Once the 
 temperature was at about 70° C., the polymerization reaction 
 was allowed to continue for one hour. The polymerization reaction was then Stopped by venting the residual propylene. 
 The polymerization reaction vessel was opened and polymer 
 was removed. 
 0.062 Catalyst productivity was measured by dividing the grams of polymer produced by the milligrams of active 
 catalyst initially charged to the reactor. Mar. 2, 2006

 alk-1-enes include linear or branches C-Co alkenes, in particular linear C-C alk-1-enes Such as ethylene, propy 
 lene, but-1-ene, pent-1-ene, hex-1-ene, hept-1-ene, Oct-1- 
 ene non-1-ene, dec-1-ene or 4-methylpent-1-ene. Mixtures 
 of these alk-1-enes may be polymerized as well. 
 0064. The catalysts of the invention are, in particular, excellent catalytic Systems for use in the production of propylene polymers, both homopolymers of propylene as 
 well as copolymers of propylene and one or more further 
 alk-1-enes having up to 10 carbon atoms. 
 0065. The term copolymers as used herein also refers to copolymers wherein the further alk-1-ene having up to 10 carbon atoms is incorporated randomly. In these copolymers 
 the comonomer content is generally less than about 15% by weight. The copolymerS may also be in the form of So-called block or impact copolymers, which comprise at least a 
 matrix of a propylene homopolymer or propylene random 
 copolymer containing less than 15% by weight of a further 
 alk-1-ene having up to 10 carbon atoms and a Soft phase of a propylene copolymer containing about 15% to about 80% 
 by weight of further alk-1-enes having up to 10 C-atoms. 
 Also mixtures of comonomers are contemplated, resulting in, e.g., terpolymers of propylene. 
 0066. The production of the propylene polymers may be 
 carried out in any common reactor Suitable for the polymer 
 ization of alk-1-enes, either batchwise or, preferably, con tinuously, i.e., in Solution (bulk phase), as Suspension poly merization or as gas phase polymerization. Examples of 
 Suitable reactors include continuously operated Stirred reac 
 tors, loop reactors, fluid bed reactors, or horizontal or 
 vertical stirred powder bed reactors. It will be understood that the polymerization may be carried out in a Series of consecutively coupled reactors. The reaction time depends 
 on the chosen reaction conditions. In general the reaction time is from about 0.2 hours to about 10 hours, usually from 
 about 0.5 hours to 5.0 hours. 
 0067. In general the polymerization is carried out at a 
 temperature in the range of from about 20° C. to about 150 C., preferably from about 50° C. to about 120° C., and more preferably from about 60° C. to about 90° C., and a pressure 
 in the range of from about 1 bar to about 100 bar, preferably 
 from about 15 bar to about 40 bar, and more preferably from 
 about 20 bar to 35 bar. 
 0068 The molecular weight of the so produced polymers 
 may be controlled and adjusted over a wide range by adding 
 polymer chain transfer or termination inducing agents as commonly used in the art of polymerization, Such as hydro 
 gen. In addition an inert Solvent, Such as toluene or hexane, or an inert gas, Such as nitrogen or argon, and Smaller amounts of a powdered polymer, e.g., polypropylene pow 
 der, may be added. 
 0069. The weight, i.e., (average molecular weights) of the propylene polymers produced by using the catalytic System 
 of the invention, in general, are in the range of from about 10,000 g/mole to 1,000,000 g/mole and the melt flow rates 
 are in the range of from about 0.1 to about 100 g/10 min, 
 preferably from about 0.5 to about 50 g/10 min. The melt flow rate corresponds to the amount which is pressed within 
 10 minutes from a test instrument in accordance with ISO US 2006/0046928A1 
 1133 at a temperature of 230 C. and under a load of 2.06 kg. Certain applications might require different molecular 
 weights than those mentioned above and are contemplated to be included among the polymers which are produced with 
 the catalysts of the invention. 
 0070 The catalytic systems of the invention enable the polymerization of alk-1-enes to produce polymers having a good morphology and a high bulk density when compared 
 with the prior art catalytic Systems. In addition, the catalytic 
 Systems of the invention have an increased productivity. 
 0071. Due to their good mechanical properties the poly merS obtainable by using the Solid catalytic component of 
 the present invention, and in particular the propylene homopolymerS or the copolymers of propylene with one or 
 more further alk-1-enes having up to 10 carbon atoms, can be used advantageously for the production of fibers or moldings, and especially for the production of films. 
 0.072 Ziegler-Natta catalysts are the subject of continued improvements, because their properties Such as activity/ productivity, morphology, and Stereospecificity Strongly 
 effect the polymerization process. 
 0073 While the invention has been described with ref erence to preferred embodiments, it will be understood by 
 those skilled in the art that various changes may be made and 
 equivalents may be substituted for elements thereof without departing from the Scope of the invention.

 57 ABSTRACT 
 A supported alpha-olefin polymerization catalyst com 
 position is synthesized by reacting (1) a slurry of a solid 
 catalyst carrier in a non-polar solvent, e.g., hexane, with a dialkyl organomagnesium composition; (2) contacting 
 the slurry of step (1) with a hydroxyl group-containing 
 compound, e.g., an alcohol; (3) contacting the slurry of 
 step (2) with at least one transition metal compound; (4) removing the non-polar solvent to obtain a dry-flowing powder; and, (5) activating the powder with trimethyl 
 aluminum. The resulting catalyst composition is ex tremely active in polymerizing C2-C10 alpha-olefins and 
 exhibits very good higher (C3-C10) alpha-olefin incor poration properties.

 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 
 1. Field of the Invention 
 The present invention relates to a method for poly merizing alpha-olefins, a catalyst for such a polymeriza 
 tion method and a method for producing such a cata lyst. In particular, the present invention relates to a catalyst, and a method for preparation thereof, which produces linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) 
 having a narrow molecular weight distribution, as evi denced by relatively low values of melt flow ratio, 
 (MFR), and low hexane extractables, suitable for film and injection molding applications. The invention is also directed to a highly productive polymerization 
 process carried out with the catalyst of the invention. 2. Description of the Prior Art Linear low density polyethylene polymers possess properties which distinguish them from other polyeth ylene polymers, such as homopolymers of polyethyl 
 ene. Certain of these properties are described in Ander 
 son et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,076,698. 
 Karol et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,302,566, describe a pro cess for producing linear low density polyethylene pol 
 ymers in a gas phase, fluid bed reactor. 
 Graff, U.S. Pat. No. 4,173,547, Stevens et al., U.S. Pat. 
 No. 3,787,384, Strobel et al, U.S. Pat. No. 4,148,754, and 
 Ziegler, deceased, et al, U.S. Pat. No. 4,063,009, each describe various polymerization processes suitable for producing forms of polyethylene other than linear low density polyethylene, per se. 
 Graff, U.S. Pat. No. 4,173,547, describes a supported catalyst obtained by treating a support with both an organoaluminum compound and an organomagnesium compound followed by contacting this treated support with a tetravalent titanium compound. 
 Stevens et al., U.S. Pat. No. 3,787,384, and Strobel et al, U.S. Pat. No. 4,148,754, describe a catalyst prepared by first reacting a support (e.g., silica containing reac tive hydroxyl groups) with an organomagnesium com pound (e.g., a Grignard reagent) and then combining 
 this reacted support with a tetravalent titanium com pound. According to the teachings of both of these patents, no unreacted organomagnesium compound is present when the reacted support is contacted with the tetravalent titanium compound. Ziegler, deceased, et al, U.S. Pat. No. 4,063,009, de scribe a catalyst which is the reaction product of an organomagnesium compound (e.g., an alkylmagnesium 
 halide) with a tetravalent titanium compound. The reac tion of the organomagnesium compound with the tetra Valent titanium compound takes place in the absence of a support material. A vanadium-containing catalyst, used in conjunction with triisobutylaluminum as a co-catalyst, is disclosed 
 by W.L. Carrick et al in Journal of American Chemical Society, Volume 82, page 1502 (1960) and Volume 83, page 2654 (1961). Nowlin et al, U.S. Pat. No. 4,481,301, disclose a sup ported alpah-olefin polymerization catalyst composi tion prepared by reacting a support containing OH groups with a stoichiometric excess of an organomag nesium composition, with respect to the OH groups 10

 content, and then reacting the product with a tetrava lent titanium compound. 
 Dombro, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,378,304 and 4,458,058, disclose an olefin polymerization catalyst composition synthesized by sequentially reacting: (1) a porous Sup port with a Group IIA organometallic compound, e.g., 
 a dialkylmagnesium; (2) the product of (1) with water or a hydrocarbyl alcohol, e.g., methanol; (3) the product of (2) with a transition metal compound or compounds. The product of the synthesis reaction is activated with a co-catalyst which is a Group IA, IIa, IIIA and/or IIB organometallic compound, including hydrogen. Suit able co-catalysts are n-butylithium, diethylmagnesium, trisobutylaluminum and diethylaluminum chloride. 
 Best, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,558,024, 4,558,025 and 4,579,835, disclose olefin polymerization catalyst com positions prepared by reacting together a porous partic 
 ulate material, an organic magnesium compound, an oxygen-containing compound, a transition metal com pound, e.g., a titanium compound (the U.S. Pat. No. 
 4,558,024) or a vanadium compound (the U.S. Pat. No. 4,579,835), and a co-catalyst. Some of the catalyst com positions of Best also include an acyl halide (e.g., see the 
 U.S. Pat. No. 4,579,835 and the U.S. Pat No. 4,558,025). When the LLDPE resins are fabricated into injec tion-molded products, it is imperative to assure that such products are not susceptible to warping or shrink 
 ing. As is known to those skilled in the art, the degree of warping or shrinking can be predicted from the molecu lar weight distribution of the resins. Resins having rela tively narrow molecular weight distribution produce injection-molded products exhibiting a minimum amount of warping or shrinkage. Conversely, resins having relatively broad molecular weight distribution produce injection-molded products more likely to un 
 dergo warping or shrinkage. One of the measures of the 
 molecular weight distribution of the resin is melt flow ratio (MFR), the ratio of high melt flow index (HLMI or I21) to melt index (I2) for a given resin. The melt flow 
 ratio is believed to be an indication of the molecular 
 weight distribution of the polymer, the higher the MFR 
 value, the broader the molecular weight distribution. Resins having relatively low MFR values, e.g., of about 20 to 50, have relatively narrow molecular weight dis tribution. Additionally, LLDPE resins having such relatively low MFR values produce films of better strength properties than resins with high MFR values. Many catalyst systems exhibit a tendency to produce 
 resins whose MFR values, although initially low, in 
 crease with increased concentration of the catalyst acti vator, also known as a co-catalyst, such as various alu minum alkyls. Under certain circumstances, e.g., to improve catalyst productivity and/or comonomer in corporation, it is desirable to increase the catalyst acti vator concentration without substantially affecting the 
 resin MFR. 
 Another important property of LLDPE resins, man ufactured into products coming into contact with arti cles subject to FDA regulations, e.g., foodstuffs, is hex 
 ane extractables which is a measure of the amount of 
 low molecular weight and/or highly branched polymer fractions capable of being extracted from the manufac tured products, e.g., plastic food containers, by hexane extraction. The FDA imposed strict regulations on the amounts of allowable hexane extractables in such plastic products. 
 Thus, Allen et al, European Patent Office (EPO) Application No. 87300536.1, published on Aug. 5, 1987, 4,849,389 3 
 as publication No. 0231102, disclose an alpha-olefin polymerization catalyst composition activated with trimethylaluminum which produces polymers having 
 relatively low values of MRF and low hexane extracta bles. However, the productivity of the polymerization 5 process carried out with such a catalyst composition is 
 lower than that of the process carried out with the same catalyst compositions activated with more commonly 
 used activators, such as triethylaluminum and triso butylaluminum. Accordingly, it is important to provide a catalyst composition capable of producing a alpha-olefin poly 
 mers having relatively narrow molecular weight distri 
 bution (low MFR values) which remains substantially constant with varying amounts of the co-catalyst, and which catalyst composition has high activity. 
 It is therefore a primary object of the present inven tion to provide a high activity catalyst for the polymeri zation of alpha-olefins yielding products of a relatively 20 
 narrow molecular weight distribution which is main tained substantially constant with varying amounts of 
 the co-catalyst concentration. 
 It is another object of the present invention to pro vide a high activity catalyst composition which pro- 25 
 duces alpha-olefin polymers having relatively low hex 
 ane extractables. 
 It is an additional object of the present invention to provide a catalytic process for polymerizing alpha-ole fins which yields linear low density polyethylene of a 30 
 relatively narrow molecular weight distribution at high productivity rates. 
 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 
 A Supported alpha-olefin polymerization catalyst 
 composition of this invention is prepared in a multi-step 
 process. In the first step, a mixture of a solid, porous 
 carrier and a non-polar solvent is contacted with at least one organomagnesium composition of the formula O

 DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE 
 INVENTION 
 The polymers prepared in the presence of the catalyst 
 compositions of this invention are linear polyethylenes which are homopolymers of ethylene or copolymers of ethylene and higher alpha-olefins. The polymers exhibit 
 relatively low values of melt flow ratio (MFR), as com pared to similar polymers prepared in the presence of previously-known catalyst compositions, e.g., those 
 disclosed by Nowlin et al, U.S. Pat. No. 4,481,301. Thus, the polymers prepared with the catalyst composi 
 tions of this invention are especially suitable for the production of films and injection molding applications. Catalysts produced according to the present inven 
 tion are described below in terms of the manner in 
 which they are made. 
 CATALYST SYNTHESIS 
 The carrier materials are usually inorganic, solid, particulate porous materials which are inert to the other components of the catalyst composition and to the other active components of the reaction system. These carrier 
 materials include such inorganic materials as oxides of 
 silicon and/or aluminum. The carrier materials are used 
 in the form of dry powders having an average particle 
 size of from about 1 micron to about 250 microns, pref erably from about 10 microns to about 150 microns. The carrier materials are also porous and have a surface area of at least about 3 square meters per gram, and prefera bly at least about 50 square meters per gram. The carrier 
 material should be dry, that is, free of absorbed water. Drying of the carrier material can be effected by heat ing at about 100 to about 1000 C. and preferably at 
 about 600 C. When the carrier is silica, it is heated at a temperature of at least 200 C., preferably at about 200 to about 850 C., and most preferably at about 600 C. 
 The carrier material must have at least some active 
 hydroxyl (OH) groups to produce the catalyst composi 
 tion of this invention. 
 In the most preferred embodiment, the carrier is silica which, prior to the use thereof in the first catalyst syn thesis step, has been dehydrated by fluidizing with ni 
 trogen and heating at about 600 C. for about 16 hours 
 to achieve a surface hydroxyl concentration of about 0.7 mmols/gm. The silica of the most preferred embodi ment is a high surface area, amorphous silica (surface area=300 m2/gm; pore volume of 1.65 cm/gm), and it 
 is material marketed under the tradenames of Davison 
 952 or Davison 955 by the Davison Chemical Division of W.R. Grace and Company. The silica is in the form of spherical particles, e.g., as obtained by a spray-drying 
 process. 
 The carrier material is slurried in a non-polar solvent and the resulting slurry is contacted with at least one organomagnesium composition having the empirical 
 formula (I). The slurry of the carrier material in the solvent is prepared by introducing the carrier material 4,849,389 5 
 into the solvent, preferably while stirring, and heating the mixture is about 25 to about 100 C., preferably about 40 to about 60° C. The slurry is then contacted with the aforementioned organomagnesium composi 
 tion, while the heating is continued at the aforemen tioned temperature. The organomagnesium composition has the empirical 
 formula Rin Mg R"", where R and R' are the same or different C4-C12 alkyl groups, preferably C4-C10 alkyl groups, more preferably C4-C8 unsubstituted alkyl groups, and most preferably both R and R' are n-butyl groups, and m and n are each 0, 1 or 2, providing that m-n is equal to the valence of Mg. Suitable non-polar solvents are materials in which all of the reactants used herein, i.e., the organomagnesium composition, the compound of formula (II) and the transition metal compounds are at least partially soluble and which are liquid at reaction temperatures. Preferred non-polar solvents are alkanes, such as hexane, n-hep tane, octane, nonane, and decane, although a variety of other materials including cycloalkanes, such as cyclo 
 hexane, aromatics, such as benzene and ethylbenzene can be employed. The most preferred non-polar solvent 
 is hexane. Prior to use, the non-polar solvent should be purified, such as by percolation through silica gel and 
 /or molecular sieves, to remove traces of water, oxy gen, polar compounds, and other materials capable of adversely affecting catalyst activity. 
 In the most preferred embodiment of the synthesis of this catalyst it is important to add only such an amount of the organomagnesium composition that will be deposited-physically or chemically--onto the support since any excess of the organomagnesium composition 
 in the solution may react with other synthesis chemi cals, and precipitate outside of the support. The carrier drying temperature affects the number of sites on the carrier available for the organomagnesium composi tion-the higher the drying temperature the lower the 
 number of sites. Thus, the exact molar ratio of the or ganomagnesium composition to the hydroxyl groups 
 will vary and must be determined on a case-by-case basis to assure that only so much of the ogranomag nesium composition is added to the solution as will be deposited onto the support without leaving any excess of the organomagnesium composition in the solution. 
 Furthermore, it is believed that the molar amout of the organomagnesium composition deposited onto the sup port is greater than the molar content of the hydroxyl groups on the support. Thus, the molar ratios given below are intended to serve only as an approximate guideline and the exact amount of the organomag nesium composition in this embodiment must be con trolled by the functional limitation discussed above, i.e., it must not be greater than that which can be deposited onto the support. If greater than the amount is added to the solvent, the excess may react with the compound of formula (II), thereby forming a precipitate outside of the support which is detrimental in the synthesis of our catalyst and must be avoided. The amount of the or ganomagnesium composition which is not greater than that deposited onto the support can be determined in any conventional manner, e.g., by adding the or ganomagnesium composition to the slurry of the carrier in the solvent, while stirring the slurry, until the or ganomagnesium composition is detected as a solution in 
 the solvent. 
 For example, for the silica carrier heated at about 200 to about 850 C., the amount of the organomag O 
 15

 35

 nesium composition added to the slurry is such that the molar ratio of Mg to the hydroxyl groups (OH) on the 
 solid carrier is about 1:1 to about 6:1, preferably about 2:1 to about 4:1, more preferably about 2.5:1 to about 3.5:1 and most preferably about 3:1, depending upon the 
 temperature at which the carrier material was dried. The organomagnesium composition dissolves in the 
 non-polar solvent to form a solution. 
 It is also possible to add such an amount of the or ganomagnesium composition which is in excess of that 
 which will be deposited onto the support and then re move, e.g., by filtration and washing, any excess of the organomagnesium composition. However, this alterna 
 tive is less desirable than the most preferred embodi 
 ment described above. 
 After the addition of the organomagnesium composi tion to the slurry is completed, the slurry is contacted 
 with at least one compound of the formula (II) 
 R'-OH (II) 
 where R' is a C1-C10 alkyl group or a C1-C10 haloge nated alkyl group, preferably R' is a C1-C10 alkyl 
 group, more preferably a C1-C4 normal alkyl group or a C1-C4 halogenated normal alkyl group, and most preferably R' is an ethyl group. Thus, the compound of 
 formula (II) is preferably an alcohol and most prefera bly ethanol. The amount of the compound of formula (II) used in this synthesis step is sufficient to convert substantially all of the magnesium alkyl (Mg-R or 
 MgR) groups on the carrier to magnesium alkoxy 
 (MgO R') groups. In a preferred embodiment, the 
 amount of the formula (II) compound added is such that substantially no excess thereof is present in the non polar solvent after substantially all of the magnesium alkyl groups are converted to the magnesium alkoxy 
 groups on the carrier to prevent the reaction of the 
 formula (II) compound with the transition metal com pound outside of the carrier. This synthesis step is con ducted at about 25 to about 65° C., preferably at about 30 to about 55 C., and most preferably at about 30 to 
 about 40 C. 
 After the addition of the formula (II) compound is completed, the slurry is contacted with at least one transition metal compound soluble in the non-polar solvent. This synthesis step is conducted at about 25 to about 65° C., preferably at about 30 to about 55 C., and most preferably at about 30 to about 40° C. In a preferred embodiment, the amount of the transition metal compound added is not greater than that which 
 can be deposited onto the carrier. The exact molar ratio 
 of Mg to the transition metal and of the transition metal to the hydroxyl groups of the carrier will therefore vary (depending, e.g., on the carrier drying temperature) and 
 must be determined on a case-by-case basis. For exam 
 ple, for the silica carrier heated at about 200 to 850 C., the amount of the transition metal compound is such that the molar ratio of the transition metal, derived from the transition metal compound, to the hydroxyl groups of the carrier is about 1 to about 2.0, preferably about 1.5 to about 2.0 and the molar ratio of Mg to the transi tion metal is about 1 to about 3, preferably about 2 to about 3. We found that these molar ratios produce a catalyst composition which produces resins having 
 relatively low melt flow ratio (MFR) values of about 20 
 to about 35. As is known to those skilled in the art, such resins can be utilized to produce high strength films and 4,849,389 7 
 injection molding products which are resistant to warp ing or shrinking. 
 Suitable transition metal compounds used herein are compounds of metals of Groups IVA, VA, VIA or VIII of the Periodic Chart of the Elements, as published by 5 the Fisher Scientific Company, Catalog No. 5-702-10, 1978, providing that such compounds are soluble in the non-polar solvents. Non-limiting examples of such com 
 pounds are titanium and vanadium halides, e.g., tita nium tetrachloride, TiCl4, vanadium tetrachloride, 10 VCl4, vanadium oxytrichloride, VOCI3, titanium and 
 vanadium alkoxides, wherein the alkoxide moiety has a 
 branched or unbranched alkyl radical of 1 to about 20 carbon atoms, preferably 1 to about 6 carbon atoms. The preferred transition metal compounds are titanium 15 compounds, preferably tetravalent titanium com pounds. The most preferred titanium compound is tita 
 nium tetrachloride. 
 Mixtures of such transition metal compounds may also be used and generally no restrictions are imposed 20 on the transition metal compounds which may be in cluded. Any transition metal compound that may be used alone may also be used in conjunction with other transition metal compounds. After the addition of the transition metal compound is completed, the non-polar 25 
 solvent is slowly removed, e.g., by distillation or evapo ration. We found that the temperature at which the non-polar solvent is removed from the synthesis mix ture affects the productivity of the resulting catalyst composition. Lower solvent removal temperatures pro- 30 duce catalyst compositions which are substantially 
 more active than those produced with higher solvent removal temperatures. For this reason, it is preferred to 
 remove the non-polar solvent at about 40 to about 65 C., preferably at about 45 to about 55° C. and most 35 preferably at about 50° C. by drying, distillation or evaporation or any other conventional means. The resulting free-flowing powder, referred to herein as a catalyst precursor, is combined with the trimethyl 
 aluminum (TMA) activator. We found that the combi- 40 nation of the precursor of this invention with the TMA activator produces an alpha-olefin polymerization cata lyst composition having very high activity, as com pared to a catalyst composition comprising the same 
 catalyst precursor and other, more conventional cata- 45 lyst activators, such as triethylaluminum (TEAL). This is additionally surprising and unexpected because other 
 workers in this field found that, although TMA exhibits some advantages with other catalyst precursor, it de creases the activity of such precursors, e.g., See Allen et 50 al, EPO Application No. 87300536.7, publication No. 0 231 102, published Aug. 8, 1987. The catalyst composition of this invention, activated with TMA, also exhibits extremely good higher alpha olefin (i.e., C3-C10 alpha-olefin) incorporation proper- 55 ties when it is used to polymerize ethylene with such higher alpha-olefins. The TMA activator is used in an amount which is at least effective to promote the poly merization activity of the solid catalyst component of 
 this invention. The amount of the TMA activator is 60 
 sufficient to give an Al:transition metal molar ratio in the catalyst composition of about 15:1 to about 1000:1, preferably about 20:1 to about 300:1, and most prefera bly about 25:1 to about 100:1. Without wishing to be bound by any theory of opera- 65 bility, it is believed that the catalyst composition of this invention is produced by chemically impregnating the support with catalyst components sequentially added to 8 
 the slurry of the carrier in the non-polar solvent. There fore, all of the catalysts synthesis chemical ingredients 
 must be soluble in the non-polar solvent used in the synthesis. The order of addition of the reagents may also be important since the catalyst synthesis procedure 
 is predicated on the chemical reaction between the chemical ingredients sequentially added to the non 
 polar solvent (a liquid) and the solid carrier material or a catalyst intermediate supported by such a material (a 
 solid). Thus, the reaction is a solid-liquid reaction. For example, the catalyst synthesis procedure must be con 
 ducted in such a manner as to avoid the reaction of two 
 or more reagents in the non-polar solvent to form a reaction product insoluble in the non-polar solvent out side of the solid catalyst support. Such an insoluble reaction product would be incapable of reacting with 
 the carrier or the catalyst intermediate and therefore would not be incorporated onto the solid support of the catalyst composition. 
 The catalyst precursors of the present invention are 
 prepared in the substantial absence of water, oxygen, and other catalyst poisons. Such catalyst poisons can be excluded during the catalyst preparation steps by any 
 well known methods, e.g., by carrying out the prepara tion under an atmosphere of nitrogen, argon or other inert gas. An inert gas purge can serve the dual purpose of excluding external contaminants during the prepara tion and removing undesirable reaction by-products resulting from the preparation of catalyst precursor. 
 Purification of the non-polar solvent employed in the catalyst synthesis is also helpful in this regard. 
 The catalyst may be activated in situ by adding the TMA activator and catalyst separately to the polymeri 
 zation medium. It is also possible to combined the cata 
 lyst and the activator before the introduction thereof into the polymerization medium, e.g., for up to about 2 
 hours prior to the introduction thereof into the poly merization medium at a temperature of from about 
 - 40 to about 100° C. 
 POLYMERIZATION 
 Alpha-olefins are polymerized with the catalysts pre 
 pared according to the present invention by any suitable process. Such processes include polymerizations car 
 ried out in suspension, in solution or in the gas phase. Gas phase polymerization reactions are preferred, e.g., 
 those taking place in stirred bed reactors and, espe cially, fluidized bed reactors. The molecular weight of the polymer may be con trolled in a known manner, e.g., by using hydrogen. With the catalysts produced according to the present 
 invention, molecular weight may be suitably controlled with hydrogen when the polymerization is carried out a relatively low temperature, e.g., from about 30 to 
 about 105 C. This control of molecular weight may be evidenced by a measurable positive change in melt index (I2) of the polymer produced. 
 The molecular weight distribution of the polymers prepared in the presence of the catalysts of the present 
 invention, as expressed by the melt flow ratio (MFR) values, varies from about 20 to about 35, preferably about 20 to about 30, for LLDPE products having a density of about 0.900 to about 0.940, and an I2 (melt index) of about 0.5 to about 100. Conversely, HDPE products, produced with the catalysts of this invention, 
 have a density of about 0.940 to about 0.965, MFR values of about 20 to about 35, preferably about 20 to 
 about 30, and I2 values of about 0.5 to about 100. As is 4,849,389 9 
 known to those skilled in the art, such MFR values are indicative of a relatively narrow molecular weight dis tribution of the polymer. As is also known to those skilled in the art, such MFR values are indicative of the polymers especially suitable for injection molding appli 
 cations since the polymers having such MFR values exhibit relatively low amounts of warpage and shrink age on cooling of the injection molded products. The relatively low MFR values of the polymers prepared 
 with the catalysts of this invention also indicate that they are suitable for the preparation of various film products since such films are likely to have excellent strength properties. MFR is defined herein as the ratio of the high load melt index (HLMI or I21) divided by the melt index, i.e.g., 
 I2 MFR as -- 
 The catalysts prepared according to the present in 
 vention are highly active and may have an activity of at least about 1-14 kilograms of polymer per gram of cata lyst per 100 psi of ethylene in about 1 hour. The linear polyethylene polymers prepared in accor 
 dance with the present invention are homopolymers of ethylene or copolymers of ethylene with one or more C3-C10 alpha-olefins. Thus, copolymers having two 
 monomeric units are possible as well as terpolymers having three monomeric units. Particular examples of such polymers include ethylene/1-butene copolymers, ethylene/1-hexene copolymers, ethylene/1-octene co polymers, ethylene/4-methyl-1-pentene copolymers, ethylene/1-butene/1-hexane terpolymers, ethylene/- propylene/1-hexane terpolymers and ethylene/- propylene/1-butene terpolymers. When propylene is 
 employed as a comonomer, the resulting linear low density polyethylene polymer preferably has at least 
 one other alpha-olefin comonomer having at least four carbon atoms in an amount of at least 1 percent by weight of the polymer. Accordingly, ethylene/propy lene copolymers are possible, but not preferred. The 
 most preferred comonomer is 1-hexene. 10

 features of the invention. However, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the specific reactants and reaction conditions used in the Examples do not limit the scope of the invention. 
 EXAMPLE 1. 
 (Catalyst Synthesis) 
 20.0 grams of Davison grade 955 silica which had 
 been heated to 600 C. for about 16 hours under a dry nitrogen purge was slurried in about 200 (milliters) mls 
 of dry hexane contained in a 4-neck 500 ml round bot tom flask kept under a continuous nitrogen purge and 
 fitted with an overhead stirrer and a reflux condenser. 
 The slurry was heated to and maintained are reflux, and 52.4 mls of dibutylmagnesium (DBM), 0.77 Molar solu tion in heptane, was added dropwise to the slurry (about 
 15 minutes) and the reflux continued for one hour. Next, 
 4.15 mls of absolute ethanol diluted in about 40 mls of 
 dry hexane was added dropwise to the slurry (about 15 
 minutes) and reflux continued for an additional hour. Finally, 2.4 mils of TiCl4 diluted in about 40 mls of dry hexane was added dropwise, the reflux was continued 
 for an additional hour, and solvents were removed by distillation and dried at about 85°-90° C. to yield 21.3 grams of a dry, free-flowing powder. The resulting 
 catalyst precursor contained 1.31 mmols of Mg/gram of the precursor, 0.731 mmols of Ti/gram of the precursor, and 2.82 mmols of Cl/gram of the precursor.

 The linear low density polyethylene polymers pro duced in accordance with the present invention prefera bly contain at least about 80 percent by weight of ethyl

 A particularly desirable method for producing linear low density polyethylene polymers according to the 
 present invention is in a fluid bed reactor. Such a reac tor and means for operating it are described by Levine et al, U.S. Pat. No. 4,011,382, Karol et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,302,566 and by Nowlin et al, U.S. Pat No. 4,481,301, the entire contents of all of which are incorporated 60 
 65 EXAMPLES 8-14 
 (Polymerization Process) 
 The catalyst precursors of Examples 1-7 were com bined with triethylaluminum (TEAL) or with trimeth ylaluminum (TMA) catalyst activators to produce ethylene/1-hexane copolymers. A typical polymeriza 
 tion was carried out as follows with the catalyst of Example 1. At about 50° C., and under a slow nitrogen purge, a 1.6 liter stainless steel autoclave, previously 4,849,389 11 
 heated to about 80° C. under purge of dry nitrogen, was filled with 400 mls of dry hexane, 200 mls of dry 1-hex ane and 3.0 mls of triethylaluminum (25 wt % in hex 
 ane). The reactor was closed, and hydrogen was intro duced to raise the internal pressure to 23 psi. The con tents of the reactor was stirred at 900 rpm and the tem perature was increased to about 70° C. The reactor was filled with ethylene to a total pres sure of about 120 psi and then 0.1637 grams of Example 1 catalyst precursor, slurried in about 25 mols of hexane, was added to the reactor. The reactor temperature was adjusted to 80 C. and the reactor pressure was main tained with ethylene. The polymerization was continued for 50 minutes. 200 grams of polyethylene were obtained. The polymer 
 contained 26.5 mole % 1-hexane and it had the follow 
 ing properties: I2 =0.58; I21 = 16.3; I21/I2 = 28.1; den sity = 0.926 gm/cc. The productivies of the catalyst compositions were 
 determined as a function of the alcohol used in the synthesis of the catalyst precursor and of the catalyst 
 activators. The results are illustrated graphically in 
 FIG.1. As is evident from FIG. 1, trichloroethanol produced the most active catalyst precursor, with the 
 TEAL or TMA activators. However, the trichloroe thanol-based-catalyst system decayed relatively rapidly 
 (half-life of about 40 minutes). The data of FIG. 1 indi cates that the TMA activator produces catalyst compo sitions having 2-3 times greater productivities than the 
 TEAL activator used to activate the same catalyst pre 
 CSOS. 
 EXAMPLE 15 
 (Comparative Catalyst Precursor Synthesis) 
 A comparative catalyst precursor was synthesized according to the teachings of Karol et al, European patent application No. 84103441.6, filed on Mar. 28, 
 1984, Publication No. 0 120 503, published on Oct. 3, 1984. This catalyst precursor is substantially equivalent 
 to that of Karol et al, as disclosed in the aforementioned Published European Patent Application. It is also sub stantially equivalent to the precursors prepared by the following representative procedure. 
 (a) Impregnation of Support with Precursor 
 In a 12 liter flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer were placed 41.8 g (0.439 mol) of anhydrous MgCl2 and 2.5 liters of tetrahydrofuran (THF). To this mixture, 
 29.0 (0.146 mol) of TiCl30.33 AlCl3 were added drop wise over a hour period. The mixture was then heated at 60° C. for another hour in order to completely 
 dissolve the material. 
 Five hundred grams (500 g) of silica were dehydrated by heating at a temperature of 600 C. and slurried in 3 liters of isopentane. The slurry was stirred while 186 ml of a 20 percent by weight solution of triethylaluminum 
 in hexane was added thereto over a hour period. The resulting mixture was then dried under a nitrogen purge at 60° C. over a period of about 4 hours to provide a dry, free-flowing powder containing 5.5 percent by 
 weight of the aluminum alkyl. 
 The treated silica was then added to the solution 
 prepared as above. The resulting slurry was stirred for hour and then dried under a nitrogen purge at 60° C. over a period of about 4 hours to provide a dry, impreg nated, free-flowing powder. (b) Preparation of Partially Activated Precursor (i) The silica-impregnated precursor composition 
 prepared in accordance with step (a) was slurried in 3 10

 liters of anhydrous isopentane and stirred while a 20 percent by weight solution of diethylaluminum chloride 
 in anhydrous hexane was added thereto over a hour period. The diethylaluminum chloride (DEAC) solu 
 tion was employed in an amount sufficient to provide 0.36 mols of this compound per mol of tetrahydrofuran 
 (THF) in the precursor. After addition of the diethylal 
 uminum chloride was completed, stirring was contin ued for an additional to hour while a 20 percent by weight solution of tri-n-hexylaluminum (TNHAL) in 
 anhydrous hexane was added in an amount sufficient to provide 0.25 mols of this compound per mol of tetrahy 
 drofuran in the precursor. The mixture was then dried under a nitrogen purge at a temperature of 56-10 C. over a period of about 4 hours to provide a dry, free flowing powder. This material was stored under dry 
 nitrogen until it was needed. 
 EXAMPLE 16 
 (Preparation of LLDPE Product. With TEAL-Activated Precursor of Example 15(b)) 
 The partially activated comparative catalyst precur 
 sor composition of Example 15(b), with the molar ratios 
 of DEAC/THF = 0.36 and TNHAL/THF=0.25, was 
 used to prepare LLDPE product in a 1.6 liter autoclave 
 reactor. Reaction conditions were similar to those in 
 Example 9. The productivity was about 4,000 grams 
 PE/gr cat/hour. 
 EXAMPLE 7 
 (Preparation of LLDPE Proccuts with TMA-Activated Comparative Precursor of Example 
 15(b)) 
 The partially activated comparative precursor com 
 position of Example 15(b) with the molar ratios of 
 DEAC/THF = 0.36 and TNHAL/THF = 0.25, was used to prepare LLDPE product in a 1.6 liter autoclave reactor. Reaction conditions were substantially equiva lent to those of Example 9, except that a TMA activator was used in place of TEAL. Catalyst productivity was 
 about 4,100 gms PE/gm cat/hour. 
 EXAMPLE 1.8 
 (Effect of Increasing Amounts of Cocatalyst on MFR of Polymers) 
 To determine the effect of increasing the amount of TMA and TEAL cocatalyst on the MFR of the poly mers produced with the resulting catalyst compositions, the performance of a catalyst precursor substantially 
 similar to that of Example 1 was compared to that of the comparative catalyst precursor of Example 15b, both 
 activated with varying amounts of the TMA or TEAL cocatalysts. The polymerizations were conducted in the 
 manner summarized below: 
 400 mls of dry hexane was added to a 1.6 liter auto clave at 56' C. while under a slow nitrogen purge. 200 mils (135 grams) of 1-hexane was added, followed by TEAL or TMA. Various amounts of cocatalyst were added to give the concentration ranges shown in FIGS. 5 and 6. Concentration of co-catalyst is expressed as ppm based on the total weight of hexane and 1-hexene used in the polymerization. The reactor was closed, and 
 hydrogen was added from a calibrated hoke bomb, the contents were stirred at 900 rpm and the temperature was increased to 70° C. Ethylene was added to the autoclave to 120 psi and about 0.03–0.06 grams of the 4,849,389 13 catalyst precursor was injected with ethylene overpres 
 sure. The temperature was maintained at 80 C. and 150-200 grams of copolymer was produced in 50-60 
 minutes. The effect of increasing amounts of the TMA or TEAL activator on the MFR of the polymers is shown graphically in FIGS. 5 and 6. 
 EXAMPLES 19-20 
 Polymerizations were carried out similarly to Exam 5 
 ples 9-14, except that 450 mls of hexane and 150 mls of 10 1-hexene were used. TEAL (3 mls of a 25 wt % solution in hexane) was used as the catalyst activator. 14 
 molecule is inserted 152 times for every 1-hexene mole cule that is inserted into the polymer molecule. 
 Molecular Weight Distribution (MWD) of Polymers 
 The effect of catalyst composition and cocatalysts on 
 the MWD of the copolymers is summarized in FIGS. 2 
 and 3. FIG. 2 shows that the MFR for the ethanol-based catalyst of Example 1 depends on both copolymer com position and cocatalyst type. For example, the MFR 
 increases from about 29 to 31 (TEAL) as the 1-hexene content increases. from 2.4 mole% (density of 0.926 gms/cc) to 4.0 mole % (density of 0.914 gms/cc). Over

 DISCUSSION OF EXAMPLES 
 The reactivity of each catalyst used to copolymerize ethylene with 1-hexene is dependent on the catalyst composition. The 1-hexene response is expressed below as a reactivity ratio, r1, defined by the equation: 
 where f=(CE/CH)copolymer 
 F=(CE/CH)monomer 
 r=kEE/kEH In the above formulae, subscripts E and H designate ethylene and hexene, respectively. Thus, lower values of r indicate improved 1-hexene incorporation proper 
 ties.

 with 1-hexene as a function of alcohol used or a transi tion metal compound on the precursor synthesis and 
 activator.

 The data of Table III indicates that the catalysts pre pared with all of the alcohols, except 2,2,2-trichlorore thanol, react relatively poorly with 1-hexene in the presence of TEAL as the activator (r1 = 196) indicating that an ethylene molecule is inserted 196 times into the polymer molecule for every 1-hexene molecule that is inserted during the polymerization reaction. In the pres ence of the TMA activator, the reactivity ratio is signifi cantly lower (r1 = 1529), indicating improved (about 22% better) 1-hexene incorporation properties with the TMA-activated catalyst precursor, i.e., an ethylene 25

 65 the same range, copolymers prepared with TMA as 
 cocatalyst have MFR values from about 27 to 29. The data therefore indicates that, unexpectedly, TMA pro vides polymers with a narrower MWD as indicated by 
 MFR values that are about 1-2 MFR units lower com 
 pared to polymers prepared with TEAL-activated cata lysts. 
 FIG. 3 shows a similar trend for other catalysts (of Examples 1, 2, 6 and 7) prepared with different alcohols with TEAL or TMA as a cocatalyst. However, the copolymer prepared with an alcohol-free catalyst pro 
 vided the broadest MWD, as indicated by MFR values of about 38 to about 42. Copolymers produced with catalysts synthesized with alcohol gave MFR values ranging from about 27 to about 35, depending on alco hol type and cocatalyst. Thus, catalysts based on etha nol and TMA give copolymers with the narrowest 
 MWD. Catalysts based on methanol and 2,2,2-trichloro ethanol produce copolymers with MFR values in the 32-37 range depending on density and cocatalyst. At the same density, these catalysts give products with MFR values about 2-6 units higher than copolymers prepared with the ethanol-based catalysts. 
 Comparison of Titanium and Vanadium Based Catalysts of Examples 6 and 6a 
 Two catalysts based on 2,2,2-trichloroethanol were prepared, one with TiCl4 (Example 6) and one with VOCl3 (Example 6A). The comparison of the effect of the transition metal on the catalyst properties is summa 
 rized in Table III. 
 The data in Tables II and III indicate that the catalyst 
 based on titanium is about 7 times more active and in 
 corporate 1-hexene about 2.5 times more slowly than 
 the vanadium-based catalyst. However, the vanadium based catalyst provides a copolymer with a relatively 
 broad MWD. 
 Effect of Drying Temperature 
 To test the effect, if any, of drying temperature on the catalyst properties, a catalyst was prepared in which the 
 temperature used to remove the solvents was lowered from 90° C. (Example 1) to 55° C. Aside from the differ ent drying temperatures, the catalyst synthesis was car ried out substantially as in Example 1. The results are 
 summarized in FIG. 4. 4,849,389 15 
 The data indicate that the productivity of this catalyst precursor is particularly sensitive to the drying condi 
 tions. The precursor dried at 55 C. is about 25 percent more productive than the precursor dried at 90° C. Consequently, to maintain high catalyst productivity, 5 
 the catalyst precursor should preferably be dried at 
 40-65 C. 
 Effect of Increasing Activator Amounts 
 The data of FIG. 5 indicates that increased content of 10 
 TEAL produces catalyst compositions which produce 
 polymers of increasing MFR values for both, the inven tive and the comparative catalyst precursor composi 
 tions. The data of FIG. 6, however, indicates that in creased content of TMA produces catalyst composi tions which produce polymers of substantially constant 
 MFR values for both the inventive and the comparative catalyst precursor compositions. 
 The ability to produce polymers of substantially con 
 stant low MFR values regardless of the cocatalyst con tent is important in order to produce the same polyeth ylene product with superior physical properties, such as low shrinking and warpage for injection molding appli 
 cations. 25

 PREPARATION OF HOMO- AND COPOLYMERS 
 OF PROPENE USINGAZEGLER-NATA 
 CATALYST SYSTEM 
 The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of homopolymers of propene and copoly 
 mers of propene with minor amounts of other C2-C12-a. monoolefins, in particular C2-C6-a-monoolefins, by polymerization, in particular dry-phase polymerization, 
 of the monomer or monomers at from 20' to 160 C, in particular from 50 to 120° C., and under from 1 to 100 in particular from 20 to 70, bar using a Ziegler-Natta catalyst system consisting of 
 (1) a titanium component which contains titanium, magnesium, chlorine and a benzenecarboxylic acid de 
 rivative on a carrier, (2) an aluminum component of the formula 
 AR3, 
 where R is alkyl of not more than 8, in particular not 
 more than 4, carbon atoms, and (3) a silane component of the formula 
 RSi(OR)4-, 
 where R1 is an aryl, alkylaryl or alkyl radical of not more than 16, preferably not more than 10, carbon atoms, in particular phenyl, tolyl or ethylphenyl, R2 is alkyl of not more than 15, preferably not more than 8, in particular not more than 4, carbon atoms and n is from 0 to 3, preferably from 0 to 2, in particular 1 to 2, with the provisos that the atomic ratio of titanium from the titanium component (1) to aluminum from the alumi num component (2) is from 1:10 to 1:800, in particular 
 from 1:20 to 1:200, and the molar ratio of aluminum component (2) to silane component (3) is from 1:0.03 to 1:08, in particular from 1:0.05 to 1:0.5. Polymerization processes of this type are known; their special feature compared with other similar pro cesses is the special embodiment of the catalyst system, and the processes disclosed in European Laid-Open application Nos. 17,895 and 144,021, European Pat. No. 
 45,977, Australian Pat. No. 543,049 and British Pat. No. 2,143,834 may be mentioned as prototypes for the pres 
 ent case. 
 The special embodiments of the catalyst systems are produced in order to achieve certain aims, such as the following: 
 The catalyst system should be easy to prepare and give an increased yield of polymer having a very large 
 isotactic fraction. In addition, particularly because of the thermodynamics of the procedure, easy molecular weight regulation, in particular with hydrogen, is of great importance. 
 The catalyst system should moreover produce poly mers having special morphological properties, for ex 
 ample uniform particle size and/or smaller fractions of very fine particles and/or a high bulk density. In addi tion to these parameters which are important for con trolling the polymerization systems, working up the 
 polymers and/or processing the latter, a low halogen content in the polymer is of importance, particularly with regard to corrosion problems; this can be achieved by increasing the polymer yield and/or by means of a catalyst system which contains very little halogen. 
 Some of these aims can be achieved by the prior art only by means of very expensive processes, as is the 2 
 case, for example, with the process according to U.S. 
 Pat. No. 4,399,054, or when other aims are neglected. For example, British Pat. No. 2,049,709 discloses a process in which a magnesium halide, a titanium halide and an electron donor are applied to a metal oxide car rier. However, the polymer obtained has a compara

 European Laid-Open application Nos. 14,523 and 
 171,200 and British Pat. Nos. 2,101,609 and 2,101,611 describe catalyst systems whose titanium component is 
 obtained by treating a solid, inorganic oxide with an organic magnesium compound, a Lewis base and tita 
 nium tetrachloride, it being necessary in addition to use a halogenating agent which is not titanium tetrachloride and/or an organic compound of the metals boron, alu 
 minum, silicon or tin or a boron trihalide or a halogen containing alcohol. Despite an expensive and tedious preparation procedure, the productivity of the corre sponding catalyst system is unsatisfactory. 
 U.S. Pat. No. 4,467,044 discloses a catalyst system which contains, as a titanium component, a silica car rier, a magnesium halide and/or manganese halide, a 
 titanium halide and an electron donor. In order to ob tain catalyst systems having relatively high productiv 
 ity, additional treatment with an organometallic com pound of a metal of groups I to III of the periodic table is indispensable here. However, the productivity and stereospecificity of the catalysts prepared in this manner 
 are, in absolute terms, low. The known processes are thus unsatisfactory, in par ticular with regard to high isotacticity and good mor phology coupled with good productivity. It is an object of the present invention to provide a titanium component which, compared with the prior art processes, has high productivity and is at the same time capable of giving polymers having high isotacticity and good morphology. 
 We have found that this object is achieved by a cata lyst system which contains a titanium component (1) prepared in three stages in a particular manner from (I) magnesium chloride, (II) a certain alkanol, (III) a cer tain carrier comprising finely divided inorganic oxide carrier material which has been pretreated with an al kylchlorosilane, (IV) titanium tetrachloride and (V) a specially selected phthalic acid derivative. The present invention accordingly relates to a pro cess for the preparation of homopolymers of propene and copolymers of propene with minor amounts of other C2-C12-a-monoolefins, in particular C2-C6-a- monoolefins, by polymerization, in particular dry-phase polymerization, of the monomer or monomers at from 20 to 160 C., in particular from 50 to 120° C., under from 1 to 100, in particular from 20 to 70, bar using a Ziegler-Natta catalyst consisting of 
 (1) a titanium component which contains titanium, magnesium, chlorine and a benzenecarboxylic acid de 
 rivative on a carrier, (2) an aluminum component of the formula 
 AR3, 
 where R is alkyl of not more than 8, in particular not 
 more than 4, carbon atoms, 
 and 
 (3) a silane component of the formula 4,843,132 3 
 where R is an aryl, alkylaryl or alkyl radical of not more than 16, preferably not more than 10, carbon atoms, in particular phenyl, tolyl or ethylphenyl, R2 is 
 alkyl of not more than 15, preferably not more than 8, in 
 particular not more than 4, carbon atoms and n is from 0 to 3, preferably from 0 to 2, in particular 1 or 2, 
 with the provisos that the atomic ratio of titanium from the titanium component (1) to aluminum from the alu minum component (2) is from 1:10 to 1:800, in particular 
 from 1:20 to 1:200, and the molar ratio of aluminum component (2) to silane component (3) is from 1:0.03 to 1:0.8, in particular from 1:0.05 to 1:0.5. In the novel process, the titanium component (1) used 
 is one which is obtained by a method in which first (1.1) in a first stage, a solid-phase intermediate is prepared from (I) finely divided magnesium chloride, (II) a C1-C8 alkanol, preferably a C2-C6-alkanol, in particular a 
 C2-C4-alkanol, (III) a carrier consisting of a finely divided, porous, inorganic oxide carrier material which has a particle diameter of from 1 to 1,000 um, in particular from 10 to 400 um, a pore volume of from 0.3 to 3, in particular from 1 to 2.5, cm/g and a surface area of from 100 to 1,000, in particular from 200 to 400, m2/g, is of the formula SiO2.a Al2O3, where a is from 0 to 2, in particu lar from 0 to 0.5, and has been pretreated with an alkyl chlorosilane of the formula R3mSiCl4-m, where R3 is C1-C10-alkyl, preferably C1-C4-alkyl and m is from 1 to 
 3, preferably 2 or 3, in particular 3, in such a way that 
 either (A) the carrier material and the alkylchlorosilane are combined once or several times, in particular twice, in a liquid inert hydrocarbon, in particular an alkane, with constant thorough mixing at from 20' to 160° C., in particular from 60 to 120° C., a total of from 1 to 50, in particular from 3 to 20, molar parts of the alkylchlorosi lane being used per 10 molar parts of the carrier mate rial, and a total of from 20 to 200, in particular from 40 to 120, molar parts of the hydrocarbon being used per 10 molar parts of the alkylchlorosilane, and the com 
 bined substances are kept at from 20' to 160 C., in particular from 60 to 120 C., for a total of from 0.1 to 5, in particular from 0.4 to 2, hours, and the resulting solid is then isolated as the carrier (III), or (B) the carrier material and the alkylchlorosilane are combined with constant thorough mixing at from 20 to 140 C., in particular from 40 to 100 C., from 5 to 50, in particular from 10 to 40, molar parts of the alkyl chlorosilane being used per 10 molar parts of the carrier material, and the combined substances are kept at a temperature in the stated range for from 0.1 to 5, in particular from 0.4 to 2, hours, and the resulting solid is then isolated as the carrier (III), (IV) titanium tetrachloride and (V) a phthalic acid derivative of the formula

 (1.1.1.a) in a first substage, the magnesium chloride (I) 
 and the alkanol (II) are combined in a liquid inert hy drocarbon, in particular an alkane, with constant thor ough mixing at from 0 to 140 C., in particular from 40 to 120° C., from 20 to 1,000, in particular from 50 to 400, parts by weight of the hydrocarbon being used per 10 parts by weight of the magnesium chloride (I) and from

 or (b) (1.1.1.b) in a first substage, the magnesium chloride 
 (I) and the alkanol (II) are combined with constant thorough mixing at from 0 to 140 C., in particular from 40 to 120° C., from 100 to 1,000, in particular from 150 to 500 molar parts of the alkanol (II) being used per 10 molar parts of the magnesium chloride (I), and the combined substances are kept at from 20' to 140°C., in particular from 40 to 120° C., for from 0.1 to 6, in particular from 0.2 to 2, hours, after which (1.1.2.b) in a second substage, the carrier (III) is intro duced into the reaction mixture resulting from the first substage with constant thorough mixing at from 0 to 140 C., in particular from 40 to 120° C., from 20 to 100, in particular from 30 to 60, parts by weight of the carrier (III) being used per 10 parts by weight of the magnesium chloride (I), and the entire mixture is evapo rated to dryness with recovery of a solid-phase reaction product, and thereafter (1.1.3) in a third substage, the solid-phase reaction product obtained in the second substage and the tita nium tetrachloride (IV) are combined in a liquid inert hydrocarbon, in particular an alkane, with constant thorough mixing at from -20 to 40 C., in particular from 10 to 30' C., from 20 to 300, preferably from 30 to 200, in particular from 50 to 150, molar parts of the titanium tetrachloride (IV) being used per 100 molar parts of the alcohol (II), and from 10 to 100, preferably from 10 to 80, in particular from 15 to 60, parts by weight of the hydrocarbon being used per 10 parts by

 weight of the titanium tetrachloride being used per 10 parts by weight of the solid-phase intermediate obtained from the first stage, and finally (1.3) in a third stage, the solid-phase intermediate obtained in the second stage is extracted with a liquid inert hydrocarbon, in particular an alkane, until the solid contains from 0.01 to 30, preferably from 0.03 to 20, in particular from 0.05 to 10, 7% by weight of free titanium tetrachloride, and the titanium component (1) 
 is obtained in this manner. Regarding the novel process, the following may be stated specifically: Provided that the defining feature is taken into ac count, the polymerization process as such can be car ried out in virtually all relevant conventional techno logical embodiments, for example as a batchwise, cyclic or, in particular, continuous process, either as a suspen sion polymerization processor, in particular, a dryphase polymerization process. The stated technological em bodiments, i.e. the technological variants of the poly merization of a-monoolefins by the Ziegler-Natta method, are well known from the literature and in prac tice and therefore require no further description. For the sake of completeness, it may be stated that, in the novel process, it is also possible to regulate the molecular weights of the polymers by the relevant con ventional measures, for example using regulators such as, in particular, hydrogen. Regarding the composition of the novel catalysts, the following may be stated specifically: (1) The liquid inert hydrocarbon to be used for the preparation of the titanium component may be a hydro 
 carbon of the type usually combined with titanium com ponents for catalyst systems of the Ziegler-Natta type 
 without causing damage to the catalyst system or its titanium component. Examples of suitable hydrocar bons are pentanes, hexanes, heptanes, gasolines and cyclohexane. 
 The finely divided magnesium chloride (I) likewise to be used may be a relevant conventional one. It should be essentially anhydrous, i.e. its water content should not exceed 1% by weight of the total amount of magne 
 sium chloride. 
 The alkanois (II) to be used for the preparation of the titanium component (1) may be conventional ones; they should advantageously have relatively high purities. Examples of suitable alkanols are ethanol, n-propyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, n-butyl alcohol, isobutyl alcohol and tert-butyl alcohol, n-butanol being particu larly suitable. The carrier (III) furthermore to be used generally contains, as a base material, an aluminosilicate or, in particular, silica; it is important that it has the required properties; it has been found that the relevant conven tional commercial carrier materials which meet the stated specification are suitable. Alkylchlorosilanes suit able for the preparation of the carrier are monoalkyltri chlorosilanes, dialkyldichlorosilanes and trialkyl mono chlorosilanes, trialkylmonochlorosilanes being particu larly suitable and trimethylchlorosilane being preferred. 
 The titanium tetrachloride (IV) likewise to be used for the preparation of the titanium component (1) should be one which is conventionally used in Ziegler Natta catalyst systems. 
 Furthermore, the phthalic acid derivative (V) defined above can be a commercial one; it should advanta geously be very pure. It has been found that phthaloyl dichloride is very particularly suitable for the purpose 10

 according to the invention; however, phthalic anhy dride and the dialkyl phthalates, in particular di-n-butyl 
 phthalate, are also suitable. The alkane to be used for the preparation of the tita nium component (1) in stage (1.3) may likewise be a 
 conventional one; it should advantageously have a rela tively high purity. 
 The preparation of the titanium component (1) is 
 simple and can be carried out by the skilled worker without explanations. Regarding stages (1.1), (1.2) and (1.3), it is merely necessary to state that the isolation of the particular resulting solid is advantageously carried 
 out by filtration under suction, which in stage (1.1) should advantageously be followed by washing with a liquid, inert hydrocarbon until the latter no longer ab 
 sorbs any titanium tetrachloride. It has been found that it may also be advantageous if the solid-phase reaction 
 product obtained in the second substance (1.1.2.a) is isolated before being used in the third substage (1.1.3), for example by evaporation to dryness. 
 (2) Suitable aluminum components (2) of the stated 
 formula are the relevant conventional ones of this for 
 mula; they are sufficiently well known from the litera 
 ture and in practice to require no further discussion. An outstanding member is, for example, triethylaluminum. (3) The silane component (3) which completes the catalyst system is, in particular, a trialkoxy(alkyl)aryl 
 or dialkoxydi(alkyl)arylsilane of the stated formula. Outstanding members are triethoxytolyl-, triethoxy(e- thylphenyl)-, dimethoxyditolyl- and dimethoxydi(ethyl phenyl)silane; other examples are trimethoxytolyl-, trimethoxy(ethylpheny)- and trimethoxyphenylsilane, triethoxyphenylsilane, dimethoxydiphenylsilane, and diethoxyditolyl-, diethoxydi(ethylphenyl)- and diethox ydiphenylsilane. 
 The novel process permits homo- and copolymers, for example of the binary or ternary type, including 
 block copolymers, of propene with minor amounts of 
 other C2-C12-a-monoolefins to be prepared in an ad vantageous manner, particularly suitable a-monoolefins as comonomers be polymerized being ethene, but-1-ene, 4-methylpent-1-ene and hex-1-ene; other suitable exam 
 ples are n-oct-1-ene, n-dec-1-ene. and n-dodec-1-ene.

 lane in such a way that the carrier material and the alkylchlorosilane are combined twice in n-heptane with constant through mixing by means of stirring at 65 C., 
 in each case 4.2 molar parts, i.e. a total of 8.4 molar parts, of the alkylchlorosilane being used per 10 molar 
 parts of the carrier material, and in each case 50 molar parts, i.e. a total of 100 molar parts, of the hydrocarbon being used per 10 molar parts of the alkylchlorosilane, 
 and the combined substances are kept in each case for 0.5 hour, i.e. for a total of 1 hour, at 85 C., and the 4,843,132 7 
 resulting solid is then isolated by filtration and washed with n-heptane to give the carrier (III), 
 (IV) titanium tetrachloride and (V) phthaloyl dichloride, in such a way that first (1.1.1.a) in a first substage, the magnesium chloride (I) and the n-butanol (II) are combined in n-heptane with constant thorough mixing by means of stirring at from 40' to 50° C., 90 parts by weight of the n-heptane being used per 10 parts by weight of the magnesium chloride (I) and 60 molar parts of the n-butanol (II) being used per 10 molar parts of the magnesium chloride (I), and the combined substances are kept at the boiling point of the n-heptane (about 98 C.) for 0.5 hour, after which (1.1.2.a) in a second substage, the carrier (III) is intro duced into the reaction mixture resulting from the first substage with constant thorough mixing by means of stirring at from 65 to 75° C., 40 parts by weight of the carrier (III) being used per 10 parts by weight of the magnesium chloride (I), and the entire mixture is left for 10 minutes at the stated temperature and then evapo rated to dryness under reduced pressure, thereafter (1.1.3) in a third substage, the solid-phase reaction product obtained in the second substage and the tita nium chloride (IV) are combined in n-heptane with constant thorough mixing by means of stirring at 25 C., 120 molar parts of the titanium tetrachloride (IV) being used per 100 molar parts of the n-butanol (II) and 20 parts by weight of the n-heptane being used per 10 parts 
 by weight of the carrier (III), after which the phthaloyl dichloride (V) is introduced, 27 molar parts of the phthaloyl dichloride (V) being used per 100 molar parts of the magnesium chloride (I), the combined substances are kept at 100° C. for 0.25 hour while stirring, and the resulting solid-phase intermediate is isolated by filtra tion under suction with removal of the liquid phase, 
 then 
 (1.2) in a second stage, the solid-phase intermediate obtained in the first stage is subjected to a two-phase 
 extraction with titanium tetrachloride at 125° C. for 0.5 hour in each stage, in each case 70 parts by weight, i.e. a total of 140 parts by weight, of the titanium tetrachlo ride being used per 10 parts by weight of the solid-phase 
 intermediate obtained from the first stage, after which the resulting solid-phase intermediate is isolated by means of filtration, and finally (1.3) in a third stage, the solid-phase intermediate obtained in the second stage is extracted with n-heptane until the solid contains 3.8% by weight of free titanium tetrachloride, and the titanium component (1) is ob tained in this manner.

 A steel autoclave having a volume of 10 l and equipped with a stirrer is charged with 50 g of polypro pene powder, 20 millimoles of triethylaluminum (in the form of a one molar solution in n-heptane) as the alumi num component (2), 2 millimoles of triethoxy-p-tolylsi lane (in the form of a one molar solution in n-heptane) as the silane component (3), 5 liters (S.T.P.) of hydrogen and finally 0.18 millimole, calculated as titanium, of the titanium component (1) described above, at 30° C. The reactor temperature is brought to 70° C. in the course of 10 minutes and the reactor pressure is brought to 28 bar in this time by forcing in gaseous propene. The actual polymerization is carried out with con 
 stant stirring at 70° C. and under 28 bar for 2 hours, monomer consumed being replaced continuously with fresh monomer. 5

 PROCESS FOR OBTAINING THE SAME 
 This application is a Continuation-In-Part of application 
 Ser. No. 10/518,443 filed Jul. 1, 2005, now abandoned which 
 is the National phase of PCT International Application No. 
 PCT/BR2002/000086 filed on Jun. 19, 2002, all of which are hereby expressly incorporated by reference into the present application. 
 The present invention relates to a solid catalyst component 
 for ethylene polymerization and copolymerization, com 
 posed of a carrier of particulate silica and a catalytically active 
 portion including titanium, magnesium, chlorine, alkoxy 
 groups and at least one organometallic compound of the 
 groups 1, 2, 12 or 13 of the periodic table. The process for 
 producing the catalyst of the present invention comprises the 
 steps of: 
 (a) impregnating an activated silica particles with a solution 
 ofan organometallic compound of the groups 1, 2, 12 or 13 
 of the periodic table, in an inert organic solvent; (b) removing the Supernatant liquid from the step (a): 
 (c) preparing a solution obtained by reacting at least one magnesium compound, selected from magnesium halides 
 and magnesium alkoxides and at least one titanium com 
 pound selected from titanium alkoxides and titanium halo gen alkoxides; 
 (d) impregnating the silica obtained in (b) using the Solution prepared in (c); 
 (e) optionally reacting the solid obtained in (d) with a reduc ing agent; 
 (f) reacting the solid obtained in (d) or (e) with a halogenating 
 agent, 
 (g) thermally treating the Solid obtained in (f); 
 (h) washing the Solid obtained in (g) with an inert organic 
 solvent; 
 (i) optionally, washing the Solid obtained in (h) with a solu tion of one or more organometallic compounds of the 
 groups 1, 2, 12 or 13 of the periodic table. The catalyst component obtained is especially suitable for the production of homo- and copolymers of ethylene as nar 
 row molecular weight distribution high density polyethylene 
 and linear low density polyethylene with controlled morphol 
 ogy and improved structure. 
 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 
 1) Polymerization Process 
 The slurry or gas phase processes for the production of 
 HDPE or LLDPE operating with low bulk density polymers 
 require reactors with large Volumes in order to obtain the necessary residence time. Particularly, in the gas phase reac 
 tors, the presence offines with low bulk density causes prob 
 lems. In fact, due to the friction of the polymer particles present in the reactor, the fines are especially prone to the 
 formation of electrostatic charges and tend to deposit and adhere to the metallic walls. These stagnant deposits do not 
 allow the exchange of the reaction heat and become hot spots, which can form layers of agglomerates containing eventually 
 melt polymer. After a period of time chunks of agglomerates can fall down and plug the product discharge system. The 
 described effects are enhanced when the reaction is carried 
 out with a highly active catalyst. 
 In U.S. Pat. No. 5,410.002 a summary of patents on the above described phenomena is presented. 10

 Therefore, it is crucial for the process that the catalyst used 
 enables a total control of the polymer morphology resulting in 
 product grains without fines, with high bulk density and good flowing properties. 
 Another very important aspect is that the catalyst must 
 have a slow decaying time to permit the use of reactors in 
 series. This arrangement makes possible the obtainment of 
 bimodal products in addition to the reduction of the total 
 volume of the reaction for the same production basis. More 
 over, process operations with a different condition of reaction 
 in at least two reactors in series, makes possible the use of catalysts with higher particle size thereby minimizing the 
 formation of electrostatic charges. 
 2) Polymer Structure 
 The catalyst properties are fundamental to the polymer 
 structure, mainly with respect to the molecular weight distri 
 bution, comonomer insertion in the polymeric chain and 
 soluble content. 
 Each application used to achieve a final product from high 
 density polyethylene (HDPE) or linear low density polyeth 
 ylene (LLDPE) requires a specific polymeric structure. 
 To obtain a film with improved optical and mechanical properties and avoid blocking problems, a polymer having a 
 narrow molecular weight distribution (MFR<27), is required. A large quantity of LLDPE applications requires products 
 with a density=0.918 and a MI=0.7, and in most cases a 
 xylene soluble content<10% is desired. Indeed, when the Xylene soluble content of the polymer is present in a high 
 concentration (>10%) and with a low molecular weight, this soluble content tends to migrate to the film Surface causing blocking, in addition to the unsatisfactory optical properties 
 (low gloss and high haze). 3) Ziegler-Natta Polyethylene Catalyst 
 Due to the strong competition existent in the polyethylene 
 market, the catalyst production cost is a fundamental compo 
 nent. Therefore it is mandatory that the catalyst for producing 
 polyethylene be manufactured by a simple route, from low 
 cost raw material, without generating gaseous, liquid or Solid 
 effluents which are hard to treat. 
 U.S. Pat. No. 5,188,997 describes a synthesis process for Ziegler-Natta catalysts from silica and magnesium chloride 
 alcoholate. The results reported demonstrate that this catalyst produces a polymer with low bulk density (0.23 to 0.30 g/ml) 
 and with an intermediate molecular weight distribution (MFR 
 30.0 to 37.8). U.S. Pat. No. 5,585,317 describes the synthesis of a cata lyst Supported on a magnesium chloride based carrier. The reported examples relates to the production of polymers hav 
 ing good morphology, characterized by the absence of fines 
 and by the high bulk density which is, for LLDPE, produced 
 between 0.32 and 0.40 g/ml and for HDPE, between 0.33 and 0.438 g/ml. 
 However, in the case of LLDPE production, the polymer 
 obtained presents an undesired comonomer distribution in its 
 chain, evidenced by the high xylene soluble content at differ ent polymer densities. As an example, a polyethylene with 
 0.919 g/ml of polymer density has a xylene soluble content of 12.5% by weight. 
 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 
 The present invention relates to a solid catalyst component for ethylene polymerization and copolymerization, com 
 posed of a carrier of particulate silica and a catalytically active portion including titanium, magnesium, chlorine, alkoxy 
 groups and at least one organometallic compound of the US 9,352,308 B2 
 3 
 groups 1, 2, 12 or 13 of the periodic table. The process for 
 producing the catalyst of the present invention comprises the 
 steps of: 
 (a) impregnating activated silica particles with a solution of an organometallic compound of the groups 1, 2, 12 or 13 of 5 
 the periodic table, in an inert organic solvent; 
 (b) removing the Supernatant liquid from the step (a): 
 (c) preparing a solution obtained by reacting at least one 
 magnesium compound, selected from magnesium halides 
 and magnesium alkoxides and at least one titanium com 
 pound selected from titanium alkoxides and titanium halo 
 gen alkoxides; 
 (d) impregnating the silica obtained in (b) using the Solution prepared in (c); 
 (e) optionally reacting the Solid obtained in (d) with a reduc ing agent; 
 (f) reacting the solid obtained in (d) or (e) with a halogenating 
 agent, 
 (g) thermally treating the Solid obtained in (f); 2O 
 (h) washing the Solid obtained in (g) with an inert organic 
 solvent; 
 (i) optionally, washing the Solid obtained in (h) with a solu 
 tion of one or more metal-alkyl halide compounds of the 
 groups 1, 2, 12 or 13 of the periodic table. 25 
 Therefore, the present invention provides a catalyst espe 
 cially suitable for the production of ethylene homo- and 
 copolymers with a narrow molecular weight distribution, 
 high density polyethylene (NMWHDPE) and a linear low 
 density polyethylene (LLDPE) with controlled morphology 
 and improved structure. 
 Additionally, the catalyst described and claimed in the 
 present invention produces a NMWHDPE with a melt flow 
 ratio (MFR) lower than 27 that is particularly suitable for thermoforming and injection applications. 
 Further, the catalyst described and claimed in the present 
 invention produces a LLDPE with a low xylene soluble con 
 tent due to the very good comonomer insertion allowing the production of films with Superior optical properties and very 40 
 low blocking. 
 The present invention further defines a catalyst that pro 
 vides, when Submitted to polymerization conditions, par ticles of polyethylene and ethylene copolymers having a high 
 bulk density and containing a very Small quantity of fines. 45 
 The present invention additionally provides a catalyst use 
 ful in liquid phase or in gas phase, ethylene polymerization 
 processes. 
 The present invention further provides a catalyst useful in 
 polymerization processes due to its high activity and low 
 decay kinetics. 10

 porous silica having an average particle size ranging from 10 
 to 120 um, preferably between 15 and 100 um, a SiO con tents of >90% by weight, a surface area ranging from 250 to 500 m/g, preferably between 300 and 400 m/g, a pore

 over a period from 1 to 20 hours. The amount of remaining 
 OH on the silica surface after this treatment ranges from 0.1 to 2 mmoles OH per g of silica, preferably between 0.5 and 
 1.5 mmoles OH per g of silica. The impregnation is preferably carried out by Suspending

 operating temperature of this step can vary from room tem perature to the boiling point of the aliphatic hydrocarbonused 
 as the solvent, preferably at room temperature. The wet silica

 According to the present invention, in step (c) of the pro 
 cess, a liquid component from the reaction between at least one magnesium compound, chosen from magnesium halides

 practice of this invention are: silanes (SiH, in which m is a number equal to or higher than 1), alkyl-silanes or aryl 
 silanes (RSiH, in which Risalkyl oraryland X is a number varying from 1 to 3) and alkoxy-silanes or aryloxy-silanes 
 (RO, SiH, in which R is alkyl or aryl and x is a number 
 varying from 1 to 3). 
 The reducing agent chosen from the above examples, pref 
 erably polymethylhydrosiloxanes (PMHS), is added to the 
 solid obtained in the step (d), dissolved preferably in the same 
 inert organic solvent used for the reaction Suspension. This 
 addition is carried out slowly over a period of time from 30 to 
 180 minutes, preferably between 50 and 80 minutes and the Solid Suspension is maintained under stirring at a temperature 
 ranging from room temperature to the boiling point of the 
 aliphatic hydrocarbon used as solvent, preferably at 60° C. 
 The amount of reducing agent that can be used in step (e) 
 corresponds to the amount ranging from 0 to 2 moles per mole 
 of titanium, preferably between 0 and 0.1 mole per mole of 
 titanium. It has been observed, in the experiments, that the 
 quantity used of this reducing agent can control the amount of 
 titanium fixed on silica at the final catalyst. In the next step of the process according to the present 
 invention, the Suspension obtained in (d) or (e), which is still under stirring, is put in contact and interacted with one or more halogenating agents. 
 Halogenating agents useful in the practice of the present 
 invention can be either liquid or gaseous materials, pure or preferably dissolved in an inert organic solvent. Representa 
 tive but non-exhaustive examples of halogenating agents use 
 ful in the present invention are methylaluminum dichloride, methylaluminum sesquichloride, isobutylaluminum dichlo 
 ride, isobutylaluminum sesquichloride, ethylaluminum 
 dichloride (EADC), diethylaluminum chloride (DEAC), ethylaluminum sesquichloride (EASC), SiCl, SnCl4, HCl, 
 Cl, HSiCl, aluminum chloride, ethylboron dichloride, boron chloride, diethylboron chloride, HCC1, PC1, POCl, acetyl chlorides, thionyl chloride, sulfur chloride, methyl 
 trichlorosilane, dimethyl dichlorosilane, TiCl, VC1, CC1, t-butyl chloride, n-butyl chloride, chloroform, 1,1,1-trichlo 
 roethane, 1.1.2-trichloroethane, 1,2-dichloroethane and 
 dichloromethane. 
 The preferred halogenating agents are chlorinating agents 
 and of these SiCl, SnCl4, HCl, Cl, HSiCl, methyl trichlo rosilane, dimethyl dichlorosilane, t-butyl chloride, n-butyl 
 chloride, chloroform, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, 1,1,2-trichloro 
 ethane, 1,2-dichloroethane and dichloromethane are pre ferred, most preferably SiCl The amount of halogenating agent used in the step (f) of the process corresponds to the amount ranging from 0.5 to 3 moles of halogenating agent per mole of titanium, preferably 
 between 1 and 1.8 moles of halogenating agent per mole of 
 titanium. 
 The time necessary for halogenating Ti-alkoxide and optionally Mg-alkoxide varies from 0.5 hour to 5 hours, pref 
 erably from 1.5 hours to 2.5 hours. The temperature of the Solid Suspension halogenation ranges from room temperature 
 to the boiling point of the aliphatic hydrocarbon used as 
 solvent, preferably at 60° C. According to the present invention, in step (g) of the pro 
 cess, the Solid obtained in (f) is kept under higher temperature 
 that depends on the inert organic solvent used. 
 The time necessary for this thermal treatment of the solid obtained in step (f) ranges from 0.5 hour to 5 hours, preferably from 3 to 5 hours. The ideal temperature for this purpose 
 depends on the organic solvent used and it can be conducted 5

 from 60° C. to 120° C., preferably from 60°C. to 75°C., when hexane is used as the organic solvent. 
 At the step (h) after the thermal treatment, the solid can be separated from the Suspension, for example by settling and 
 siphoning, filtration or centrifugation, washed with an inert 
 organic solvent, preferably hexane, and then dried. The wash ing temperature can vary from room temperature to the boil 
 ing point of the aliphatic hydrocarbon used as solvent, pref erably at room temperature. 
 Optionally, the solid obtained in (h) is washed with a solu tion of organometallic compounds of the groups 1, 2, 12 or 13. 
 More specifically, in the optional step (i) the solid obtained in 
 step (h) is suspended in an inert organic solvent such as 
 hexane or heptane, and it is put in contact with one or more organometallic compounds of the groups 1, 2, 12 or 13 of the periodic table, preferably metal-alkyl compounds or metal 
 alkylhalide compounds belonging to these groups, in special 
 aluminum, magnesium, lithium and Zinc compounds. Spe cific examples of these compounds are methylaluminum 
 dichloride, methylaluminum sesquichloride, isobutylalumi 
 num dichloride, isobutylaluminum sesquichloride, ethylalu 
 minum dichloride (EADC), diethylaluminum chloride (DEAC), ethylaluminum sesquichloride (EASC), tri-n-hexy 
 laluminum (Tn-HAL), tri-n-octylaluminum (TnOAL). They 
 can be used concentrated or preferably dissolved in the above organic solvent or in a different organic solvent chosen from aliphatic hydrocarbons. The process is carried out at a tem perature ranging from room temperature to the boiling point 
 of the organic solvent used as solvent, preferably at room temperature, for a period of time that can vary from 10 min 
 utes to 24 hours, preferably from 40 minutes to 5 hours. When using more than one organometallic compound in 
 the step (i), the different compounds can be fed in the same 
 Solution or in individual Solutions, at the same time or in Subsequent additions. 
 The amount of the metal-alkyl halide compound of the groups 1, 2, 12 or 13 or metal-alkyl compound of the groups 
 1, 2, 12 or 13, used in the step (i) of the process corresponds 
 to the amount ranging from 0 to 3 g of the corresponding metal-alkyl halide compound of the groups 1, 2, 12 or 13 or 
 metal-alkyl compound of the groups 1, 2, 12 or 13, per g of 
 dry catalyst component obtained, preferably between 0.05 and 1 g of the corresponding metal-alkylhalide compound of 
 the groups 1, 2, 12 or 13 or metal-alkyl compound of the groups 1, 2, 12 or 13, per g of dry catalyst component 
 obtained. 
 The use of inert organic solvents, most specifically ali phatic hydrocarbons, in all process steps of the present inven 
 tion brings another important feature to the Solid catalyst 
 component characteristics. The Solid catalyst component 
 obtained is completely free of residual polar solvents, such as 
 ethanol, and their derivatives in its final composition. 
 The titanium amount that remains fixed on the Solid cata 
 lyst component may reach up to 10% by weight, expressed as 
 the Timetal content, and it is preferably comprised between 0.5 and 2% by weight. 
 The magnesium amount that remains fixed on the Solid catalyst component may reach up to 6% by weight, expressed 
 as the Mg metal content, and it is preferably comprised 
 between 0.3 and 3.0% by weight. 
 The chlorine amount that remains fixed on the solid cata 
 lyst component may reach up to 20% by weight, expressed as 
 the C1 contents, and it is preferably between 5 and 12% by weight. 
 The alkoxy amount that remains fixed on the Solid catalyst component may reach up to 20% by weight and it is prefer 
 ably between 3 and 8% by weight. US 9,352,308 B2 
 The amount of organometallic compound of the groups 1, 
 2, 12 or 13 that remains fixed on the solid catalyst component may reach up to 5% by weight, expressed as the metal con 
 tents, and it is preferably between 0.3 and 3% by weight. This organometallic compound of the groups 1, 2, 12 or 13 are metal-alkyl compounds or metal-alkyl halide compounds belonging to these groups, in special organoaluminum, orga 
 nomagnesium, organolithium and organozinc compounds, 
 pure or in mixtures. The particle size distribution of the solid catalyst compo 
 nent of the present invention is very close to the silica used as carrier and, as consequence, its average particle size ranges 
 also from 10 to 120 um. The solid catalyst component surface area ranges from 80 to 300 m/g and its pore volume ranges 
 from 0.1 to 1.0 ml/g. The catalyst component of the present invention is Suitable for using in liquid phase or gas phase, ethylene polymeriza 
 tion process. The co-catalyst used in the polymerization pro 
 cess is an alkyl-aluminum, preferably trimethyl aluminum or 
 triethyl aluminum. The mass ratio co-catalyst:catalyst in the polymerization process is between 0.5:1 and 6.0:1. 
 An important feature is its ability to produce, when sub 
 mitted to polymerization conditions, particles of homo and copolymers of ethylene with controlled morphology having 
 high bulk density and containing a very Small quantity of 
 fines. This feature allows the use of this catalyst in a process where the catalyst can be fed directly into the polymerization 
 reactor. Particular forms to feed the catalyst are in dry bulk powder, in paste, in oil Suspension or in solvent Suspension. 
 As an alternative the catalyst can be prepolymerized with 
 ethylene or propylene and optionally with a comonomer 
 before being fed into the reactor. Another important feature of the present invention is its tolerance to the high electrostatic charges occurring in gas 
 phase reactors. This feature helps to prevent the formation of 
 polymer sheets or agglomerates on the reactor walls. The 
 good catalytic yield and the low decay kinetics observed for 
 the present invention, allows its use in most polymerization processes, including processes operating in more than one 
 reactor in series. 
 A further feature characteristic of the catalyst of the present invention is when using a microspheroidal silica as Support 
 the catalyst obtained has also a spheroidal morphology and in consequence a polymer product with good morphology and 
 flowability is obtained. 
 The catalyst component of the present invention is advan tageously used in the polymerization of ethylene and mix 
 tures thereof with alpha-olefins CH2=CHR, wherein R is an alkyl or cicloalkyl or aryl radical with 1-12 carbon atoms 
 because it has a high activity and low decay kinetics. In particular, it is used in the preparation of: High density polyethylenes (HDPE, having a density greater than 0.940 g/cm), particularly with narrow 
 molecular weight distribution (MFR-27), including homopolymers of ethylene and copolymers of ethylene 
 with one or more alpha-olefins having from 3 to 14 
 carbon atoms. These products are particularly Suitable for thermoforming and injection applications; 
 Linear medium density and linear low density polyethyl 
 enes (LMDPE and LLDPE, having a density lower than 0.940 g/cm) most specifically very low and ultra low 
 density linear polyethylenes (VLDPE and ULDPE, hav ing a density lower than 0.920 g/cm and as low as 0.880 g/m) consisting of copolymers of ethylene with one or 
 more alpha-olefins having from 3 to 14 carbon atoms, having a content of units derived from ethylene greater than approximately 80% by weight. These products 10

 have an improved structure due to the very good 
 comonomer insertion and, in most cases, they have also 
 a narrow molecular weight distribution (MFR-27). 
 Hence the low xylene soluble contents are obtained, allowing the production of films with superior optical 
 properties and very low blocking. The LMDPE products are particularly useful for rotomolding applications; 
 Elastomeric copolymers of ethylene and propylene and 
 elastomeric terpolymers of ethylene and propylene with 
 minor amounts of a diene, having a content of units derived from ethylene comprised between about 30 and 70% by weight.

 stirring at 150 rpm, it was diluted with 3200 ml of anhydrous 
 hexane. Into this solution kept at 40° C. and under the same stirring, 250g of the silica support were added. This silica was 
 previously dehydrated and treated with 19 ml (0.139 moles) of triethylaluminum diluted in anhydrous hexane, for 50 min

 Make-up components are fed to the system at spot 8 so as 
 to make up the composition of recycle stream 5. So, make-up 
 stream 8 will include the triethyl aluminum (TEAL) that 
 directly reacts in a ratio of 2 moles of TEAL per mole of 
 catalyst. Also at the spot 8, propane is fed as the selected 
 non-reactive compound required to maintain the total pres 
 Sure of the system. 
 The polymerization catalyst is introduced as a dry powder 
 by a catalyst feeder into reactor 1 in a site within the reaction Zone 3, close to the distributing plate 9 in a rate to control the residence time of the catalyst. The reactive gases, including 
 ethylene and comonomers are introduced at the spot 10. 60

 The produced polymer is discharged from the reaction Zone through a discharge system 11 that provides the recovery 
 of the reactive and non-reactive gases, recycling said gases back to the recycle stream 5 at spot 12 and lowers the pressure of the discharged mixture of polymer and gases at certain pressure for later conveying the produced polymer particles 
 13 for downward sampling. 
 Examples 13 to 23 
 The examples 13 to 23 were conducted in the gas phase pilot reactor at 88°C., using in each EXAMPLE respectively the catalysts produced in the EXAMPLES 1 to 10. The cata lyst produced in the EXAMPLE 10 was also used in the pilot polymerization at 75° C. as shown in the EXAMPLE 23. In all examples the pilot reactor run was performed Smoothly, with good catalytic yield and no agglomerates or 
 sheets were formed. The polymers obtained had a good mor 
 phology and, in most cases, less than 1% of fines (<250 um). The films obtained with these polymers presented very good optical properties and a low blocking strength. 
 During the performance of the EXAMPLE 20 it was per 
 formed a decay test and the measured half-life time was 3.8 
 hours.

 HIGH STRENGTH POLYETHYLENE FILM 
 TECHNICAL FIELD 
 This invention relates to a process for preparing an in Situ polyethylene blend, which can be converted into film having an improved balance of high Strength and exemplary extru 
 Sion characteristics. 
 BACKGROUND INFORMATION 
 There has been a rapid growth in the market for linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), particularly resin made under mild operating conditions, typically at preSSures of 100 to 300 psi and reaction temperatures of less than 100 C. This low pressure proceSS provides a broad range of LLDPE products for blown and cast film, injection molding, rotational molding, blow molding, pipe, tubing, and wire and cable applications. LLDPE has essentially a linear 
 backbone with only short chain branches, about 2 to 6 carbon atoms in length. In LLDPE, the length and frequency of branching, and, consequently, the density, is controlled by 
 the type and amount of comonomer used in the polymer ization. Although the majority of the LLDPE resins on the market today have a narrow molecular weight distribution, LLDPE resins with a broad molecular weight distribution are available for a number of non-film applications. LLDPE resins designed for commodity type applications 
 typically incorporate 1-butene as the comonomer. The use of a higher molecular weight alpha-olefin comonomer pro duces resins with Significant Strength advantages relative to those of ethylene/1-butene copolymers. The predominant 
 higher alpha-olefin comonomers in commercial use are 1-hexene, 4-methyl-1-pentene, and 1-octene. The bulk of the LLDPE is used in film products where the excellent physical properties and drawdown characteristics of LLDPE film makes this film well Suited for a broad Spectrum of appli cations. Fabrication of LLDPE film is generally effected by the blown film and Slot casting processes. The resulting film is characterized by excellent tensile Strength, high ultimate elongation, good impact Strength, and excellent puncture 
 resistance. 
 These properties together with toughneSS are enhanced when the polyethylene is of high molecular weight. However, as the molecular weight of the polyethylene increases, the processability of the resin usually decreases. By providing a blend of polymers, the properties character 
 istic of high molecular weight resins can be retained and processability, particularly the extrudability (from the lower molecular weight component) can be improved. 
 The blending of these polymerS is Successfully achieved 
 in a Staged reactor proceSS Similar to those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,047,468 and 5,149,738. Briefly, the process is one for the in Situ blending of polymers wherein a higher density ethylene copolymer is prepared in a high melt indeX reactor and a lower density ethylene copolymer is prepared 
 in a low melt indeX reactor. The process typically comprises continuously contacting, under polymerization conditions, a 
 mixture of ethylene and one or more alpha-olefins with a catalyst System in two gas phase, fluidized bed reactors connected in Series, said catalyst System comprising: (i) a Supported magnesium/titanium based catalyst precursor; (ii) an aluminum containing activator compound; and (iii) a hydrocarbyl aluminum cocatalyst, the polymerization con ditions being Such that an ethylene copolymer having a melt 
 index in the range of about 0.1 to about 1000 grams per 10 
 minutes is formed in the high melt indeX reactor and an ethylene copolymer having a melt indeX in the range of 
 about 0.001 to about 1 gram per 10 minutes is formed in the low melt indeX reactor, each copolymer having a density of 
 about 0.860 to about 0.965 gram per cubic centimeter and a melt flow ratio in the range of about 22 to about 70, with the provisoS that: 1O

 While the in situ blends prepared as above and the films produced therefrom are found to have the advantageous 
 characteristics heretofore mentioned, the commercial appli cation of these granular bimodal polymerS is limited by unacceptable levels of gels in contrast to competitive bimo dal resins produced from Slurry or Solution processes. Par 
 ticle size distribution and flow characteristics Studies indi 
 cate that the gas phase resins having an average particle size (APS) of about 400 to about 600 microns exhibit significant compositional, molecular, and rheological heterogeneities. When Such a granular resin is compounded, for example, 
 with a conventional twin Screw mixer in a single pass, and the resulting pellets are fabricated into film, the film exhibits a high level of gels ranging in size from less than about 100 microns to greater than about 500 microns. These gels adversely effect the aesthetic appearance of the product. The gel characteristics of a film product are usually designated by a subjective scale of Film Appearance Rating (FAR) varying from minus 50 (very poor; these films have a large number of large gels) to plus 50 (very good; these films have a Small amount of, or essentially no, gels). The FAR of the Single pass film product mentioned above is generally in the 
 range of about minus 50 to about minus 10/0. For commer cial acceptability, the FAR should be plus 20 or better. Several patents have Successfully addressed the gel prob 
 lem. One such patent is U.S. Pat. No. 5,405,901. Unfortunately, this patent, for example, Suffers from other 
 deficiencies. The extrusion line Speed of the product resin, which is a measure of bubble strength and stability, is found to be in the neighborhood of 90 feet per minute, and the dart drop Strength, while high for one mil film, is not achievable 
 on 0.5 mil film due to low bubble stability. Meanwhile, in the realm of high and medium density, high molecular weight film applications, industry is Seeking resins with minimum 
 extrusion line Speeds of about 210 feet per minute and thus films with higher bubble strength and stability together with higher dart drop Strength in the narrower gauges. 
 DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION

 Strength, particularly in terms of dart drop. Other objects and 
 advantages will become apparent hereinafter.

 from the first reactor to about the initial level of activity 
 in the first reactor. 
 DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED 
 EMBODIMENT(S) 
 AS noted, the blend is produced in two staged reactors 
 connected in Series wherein a mixture of resin and activated 
 catalyst precursor is transferred from the first reactor to the 
 Second reactor in which another copolymer is prepared and 
 blends in situ with the copolymer from the first reactor. It 
 will be understood by those skilled in the art that the transfer is effected without exposing the mixture to the atmosphere. 
 The copolymers produced in each of the reactors are copolymers of ethylene and at least one alpha-olefin 
 comonomer having 3 to 8 carbon atoms, preferably one or two alpha-olefin comonomers. The alpha-olefins can be, for example, propylene, 1-butene, 1-hexene, 4-methyl-1- 
 pentene, and 1-octene. 15

 Preferred comonomer combinations: 
 first reactor second reactor 
 1-hexene 1-hexene 
 1-butene 1-hexene 
 1-butene 1-butene 
 1-hexene 1-butene 
 The 1-hexene/1-hexene combination is found to give the best film properties; however, the 1-hexene/1-butene com bination is found to provide acceptable properties while Still meeting FDA Specifications since a terpolymer increases the 
 FDA allowable comonomer content, e.g., for a 1-hexene copolymer, the maximum allowable comonomer content is 10 percent by weight whereas for a 1-hexene/1-butene terpolymer, the maximum allowable comonomer content is 15 percent by weight. For FDA purposes, the 1-hexene/1- 
 hexene combination is considered a copolymer and the 1-hexene/1-butene combination is considered a terpolymer. 
 It will be understood that the in situ blend can be 
 characterized as a bimodal resin. The properties of bimodal resins are Strongly dependent on the proportion of the high 
 molecular weight component, i.e., the low melt indeX com ponent. For a Staged reactor System, the proportion of the high molecular weight component is controlled via the relative production rate in each reactor. The relative produc 
 tion rate in each reactor can, in turn, be controlled by a computer application program, which monitors the produc 
 tion rate in the reactors (measured by heat balance) and then manipulates the ethylene partial preSSure in each reactor and 
 catalyst feed rate in order to meet the production rate, the production rate Split, and catalyst productivity requirements. 
 It will be further understood that there may be a second alpha-olefin comonomer in each reactor coming from a vent recovery System, for example. In this case, recovered liquids 
 containing both comonomers are fed into the first reactor and there is carryover from the first reactor to the Second reactor due to the Solubility of the comonomer in the resin. This could account for a terpolymer in each reactor. The molar ratio of C6 to C4 (or other combination of higher alpha-olefin to lower alpha-olefin) is preferably no less than 
 about 5:1 in the first reactor. Any molar ratio is Satisfactory in the Second reactor. In any case, the overall molar ratioS of alpha-olefin to ethylene in each reactor do not change. 
 High speed extrusion bubble stability is an important 
 factor in blown film extrusion processes. A blown film extrusion proceSS is one in which molten polymer is forced through an annular die to form a continuous cylindrical tube. 
 Outside the die, the tube is blown out to a larger diameter than the die diameter, cooled by an air ring, and then flattened before wind-up. The ratio of the final diameter of the cylindrical tube to the diameter of the annulus is called the blow-up ratio (BUR). The combination of the extrusion rate, BUR, and the speed with which the tube is drawn out determines the final film thickness. The ability to produce thinner films at higher rates of extrusion is governed by many factors including the molecular and Theological char acteristics of the molten polymer, dependence of properties on temperature, and the design of the air ring. 
 The entire cylindrical tube between the die and the collapsing frame (where the tube is flattened) is called the “bubble.” This is a cylindrical bubble in contrast to tradi tionally familiar spherical bubbles in which air, or some other gas, is enveloped by a thin liquid film. Here, air is used 
 to blow a thin molten polymer film. The bubble looks conical from the outside because of a change in the diameter until the solidification at the frost-line height (FLH). US 6,248,831 B1 
 S 
 Sometimes, e.g., with high density polyethylene, the bubble 
 looks like a cylindrical Semi-molten tube with a diameter approximately equal to the ring diameter before being blown 
 out into a larger diameter. Past the FLH, however, the shape does not change from a circular cylindrical tube of constant 
 diameter. Note that between the die and the FLH the bubble 
 is always Semi-molten. 
 One would like to produce a final film with close tolerance in film thickneSS under Stable conditions of operation. That is, the shape of the bubble remains the same without any change over time. The highest extrusion rate and the highest wind-up speed that can be used without changing the shape of the bubble provides the operating constraints for a given resin in a given System (extruder, air ring, cooling air temperature, etc.). For example, at a given extrusion rate, if one can increase the wind-up speed to make thinner film without losing the shape of the bubble, then the resin is said to have good high Speed extrusion bubble Stability. 
 Often, the bubble stability within a given extrusion sys 
 tem is directly related to the molecular characteristics which influence the behavior of the bubble. For example, it is easier to Stretch chewing gum into a very thin thread without breakage than a rubber band. A rubber band stiffens as it is Stretched and, beyond a certain point, it will break. However, the stiffening of the rubber band also gives it better stability 
 since it will be less sensitive to external disturbances. This 
 is not the case with the chewing gum Since it deforms very 
 easily and is very sensitive to disturbances. In the blown film concept, one would like to have rubber band behavior as the bubble is being blown and stretched rather than a chewing gum behavior. In this invention, the combination of a particular precursor, in Situ blending, ethylene partial 
 preSSure, and other defined parameters has been found to provide better high speed extrusion bubble stability, i.e., the film can be drawn at higher wind-up speeds to produce 
 thinner films. 
 The magnesium/titanium based catalyst System can be 
 exemplified by the catalyst system described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,122,494. This System includes a precursor, an activator, and a cocatalyst. The precursor can be Supported or unsup ported. The precursor (prior to activation) is formed by contacting a magnesium alkoxide, a titanium tetraalkoxide, and Small amount of a Solubility enhancing agent which can be a species Such as carbon dioxide, triethylborate, a bromide, or a phenolic compound Selected from the group consisting of phenol and a phenol Substituted with an alkyl, an alkoxy, a halogen, or a dialkylamino group and can be 
 isolated as a solid either by removal of solvent (as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,106,806) or by precipitation as a halide complex (as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,066,737). The reaction product can be represented essentially by the for mula MgTiOOR):X wherein each R is independently an alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, preferably ethyl, and 
 each X is independently a halide anion or a monovalent anion of a phenolic compound. X is preferably chloride or an anion of ortho-cresol or 2,6-di-t-butyl-4-methylphenol. The precursor is partially activated by contacting with an alkylaluminum halide. The alkylaluminum halide is an acti Vator compound and can be represented by the formula 
 RATY, wherein R is an alkyl group having 1 to 8 carbon atoms, Y is a halogen Such as chlorine, bromine, or iodine, preferably chlorine; and n is 1 or 2. More detail can be found in U.S. Patent application Ser. No. 09/395,924 filed on Sep. 14, 1999, particularly examples 5 and 7. 
 Preferred activators include alkylaluminum mono- and 
 dichlorides wherein each alkyl radical has 1 to 6 carbon atoms. Examples of preferred activators are diethylalumi num chloride (DEAC) and ethylaluminum dichloride (EADC). Other conventional activators can also be used if desired. The molar ratio of activator to titanium can be in the 15

 range of about 1:1 to about 150:1 and is preferably in the range of about 10:1 to about 30:1. The cocatalyst, generally a hydrocarbyl aluminum cocatalyst, can be represented by the formula R.Al, (RAIO), or RAIX wherein each R is independently alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, or hydrogen; at least one R is hydrocarbyl, and two or three R radicals can be joined to form a heterocyclic Structure. Each R, which is a hydrocarbyl radical, can have 1 to 20 carbon atoms, and preferably has 1 to 10 carbon atoms. X is a halogen, preferably chlorine, bromine, or iodine. Examples of hydrocarbyl aluminum compounds are as follows: triisobutylaluminum, tri-n-hexylaluminum, di-isobutyl-aluminum hydride, dihexylaluminum dihydride, di-isobutyl-hexylaluminum, isobutyl diheXylaluminum, trimethyl-aluminum, triethylaluminum, tripropylaluminum, 
 trii Sopropylaluminum, tri-n-butyl aluminum, trioctylaluminum, tridecylaluminum, tridodecylaluminum, 
 tribe in Zyl aluminum, trip he nylaluminum, trinaphthylaluminum, tritolylaluminum, dibutylaluminum 
 chloride, diethylaluminum chloride, and ethylaluminum Ses quichloride. The cocatalyst is preferably added Separately 
 neat or as a Solution in an inert Solvent, Such as isopentane, to the polymerization reactor at the Same time as the flow of ethylene is initiated. The cocatalyst compounds can also be 
 used as the activators referred to above. 
 As noted in U.S. Pat. No. 5,122,494, selectivity control agents can be used in the polymerization proceSS if desired, preferably when the primary olefin is propylene. 
 AS noted above, the precursor can be prepared as a granular Solid or as a Solution. In those cases where it is desired to Support the Soluble precursor, Silica is the pre ferred Support. Other Suitable Supports are inorganic oxides 
 Such as aluminum phosphate, alumina, Silica/alumina mixtures, Silica modified with an organoaluminum com pound Such as triethylaluminum, and Silica modified with diethyl Zinc. A typical Support is a Solid, particulate, porous 
 material essentially inert to the polymerization. It is used as a dry powder having an average particle size of about 10 to 
 about 250 microns and preferably about 30 to about 100 microns, a Surface area of at least 200 Square meters per gram and preferably at least about 250 Square meters per gram; and a pore Size of at least about 100 angstroms and preferably at least about 200 angstroms. Generally, the 
 amount of support used is that which will provide about 0.1 to about 1.0 millimole of titanium per gram of Support and preferably about 0.4 to about 0.9 millimole of titanium per gram of Support. Impregnation of the above mentioned Soluble catalyst precursor into a Silica Support can be accom plished by mixing the precursor Solution and Silica gel in the 
 electron donor solvent or other solvent followed by solvent removal under reduced preSSure. When a Support is not desired, the Soluble catalyst precursor can be used in liquid 
 form. 
 The entire catalyst System, which includes a partially activated precursor and the cocatalyst, is added to the first reactor. The catalyst is admixed with the copolymer pro 
 duced in the first reactor, and the mixture is transferred to the Second reactor. Insofar as the catalyst is concerned, only cocatalyst is added to the Second reactor from an outside 
 SOCC. 
 The polymerization in each reactor is, preferably, con ducted in the gas phase using a continuous fluidized process. 
 A typical fluidized bed reactor is described in U.S. Pat. No. 
 4,482,687. A relatively low melt index (or high molecular weight) copolymer is prepared in the first reactor. The first reactor is generally Smaller in size than the Second reactor because only a portion of the final product is made in the first reactor. The mixture of polymer and an active catalyst is usually 
 transferred from the first reactor to the Second reactor via an US 6,248,831 B1 
 7 
 interconnecting device using nitrogen or Second reactor recycle gas as a transfer medium. 
 In the high molecular weight (HMW) reactor: 
 Because of the low values, instead of melt index, flow 
 indeX is determined and those values are used in this 
 specification. The flow index (I 21.6) can be in the range of about 0.20 to about 5.0 grams per 10 minutes, and is preferably in the range of about 0.25 to about 4 grams per 10 minutes. The molecular weight of this polymer is, generally, in the range of about 250,000 to about 600,000. The density of the copolymer can be in the range of 0.890 to 0.940 gram per cubic centimeter, and is preferably in the range of 0.900 to 0.935 gram per cubic centimeter. The melt flow ratio (I 21.6/I 2.16) of the polymer can be in the range of about 20 to about 65, and is preferably about 22 to about 
 50. 
 Melt index (I 2.16) is determined under ASTM D-1238, Condition E. It is measured at 190° C. and 2.16 kilograms and reported as grams per 10 minutes. Melt index (I 5) can also be determined under ASTM D-1238, Condition P. It is measured at 190° C. and 5 kilograms and reported as grams per 10 minutes. Flow index (I 21.6) is determined under ASTM D-1238, Condition F. It is measured at 190° C. and 21.6 kilograms and reported as grams per 10 minutes. Melt 
 flow ratio is the ratio of flow index (I 21.6) to melt index (I 2.16 or I 5). 
 In the low molecular weight (LMW) reactor: 
 A relatively high melt index (I 2.16) (or low molecular weight) copolymer is prepared in this reactor. The high melt index can be in the range of about 80 to about 1000 grams per 10 minutes, and is preferably in the range of about 150 to about 900 grams per 10 minutes. The molecular weight of the high melt indeX copolymer is, generally, in the range of about 15,000 to about 35,000. The density of the copolymer prepared in this reactor can be in the range of 0.925 to 0.970 gram per cubic centimeter, and is preferably in the range of 
 0.928 to 0.965 gram per cubic centimeter. The melt flow ratio (I 21.6/I 2.16) of this copolymer can be in the range of about 20 to about 65, and is preferably about 22 to about 50. 
 The blend or final product, as removed from the second reactor, can have a melt index (I5) in the range of about 0.01 to about 2.0 grams per 10 minutes, and preferably has a melt index in the range of about 0.05 to about 1.0 grams per 10 minutes. The melt flow ratio (I 21.6/I 5) is in the range of about 20 to about 45, and is preferably in the range of about 22 to about 42. The average molecular weight of the final product is, generally, in the range of about 200,000 to about 
 350,000. The density of the blend can be in the range of 0.915 to 0.958 gram per cubic centimeter, and is preferably in the range of 0.920 to 0.955 gram per cubic centimeter. 
 The blend has a broad molecular weight distribution 
 which can be characterized as bimodal. The broad molecular 
 weight distribution is reflected in an Mw/Mn ratio of about 18 to about 32, preferably about 20 to about 30. Mw is the weight average molecular weight, Mn is the number average 
 molecular weight; and the Mw/Mn ratio can be referred to as the polydispersity index (PDI), which can be viewed as a measure of the breadth of the molecular weight distribution. 
 The weight ratio of copolymer prepared in the high molecular weight reactor to copolymer prepared in the low 
 molecular weight reactor can be in the range of about 0.8:1 to about 2.3:1, and is preferably in the range of about 0.9:1 to about 1.9:1. The optimum weight ratio is about 1.2:1 to about 1.5:1. This is also known as the split. The magnesium/titanium based catalyst System, ethylene, alpha-olefin, and hydrogen are continuously fed into the first reactor; the polymer/catalyst mixture is continuously trans 
 ferred from the first reactor to the Second reactor; ethylene, alpha-olefin, and hydrogen, as well as cocatalyst are con 15

 tinuously fed to the Second reactor. The final product is continuously removed from the Second reactor. 
 In the low melt index, as reflected in flow index reactor, i.e., the first reactor: The mole ratio of alpha-olefin to ethylene can be in the range of about 0.005:1 to about 0.4:1, and is preferably in the range of about 0.02:1 to about 0.26:1. The mole ratio of hydrogen to ethylene can be in the range 
 of about 0.0001:1 to about 0.3:1, and is preferably in the range of about 0.001:1 to about 0.18:1. The operating temperature is generally in the range of about 60° C. to about 100° C. Preferred operating temperatures vary depending on 
 the density desired, i.e., lower temperatures for lower den Sities and higher temperatures for higher densities. 
 In the high melt indeX reactor, i.e., the Second reactor: The mole ratio of alpha-olefin (optional) to ethylene can 
 be in the range of about 0.005:1 to about 0.6:1, and is preferably in the range of about 0.01:1 to about 0.42:1. The mole ratio of hydrogen to ethylene can be in the range of 
 about 1.0:1 to about 3:1, and is preferably in the range of about 1.3:1 to about 2.2:1. The operating temperature is generally in the range of about 70° C. to about 110° C. As mentioned above, the temperature is preferably varied with the desired density. 
 The total reactor pressure in the Second reactor is usually higher than that used in the first reactor because of higher ethylene partial pressures and high hydrogen/ethylene 
 requirements. The pressure, i.e., the total pressure in each 
 reactor, can be in the range of about 200 to about 450 psig and is preferably in the range of about 280 to about 400 psig. The ethylene partial pressure in the first reactor can be in the range of about 10 to about 100 psi and is preferably in the range of about 20 to about 60 psi. The ethylene partial 
 preSSure in the Second reactor can be in the range of about 50 to about 120 psi and is preferably in the range of about 60 to about 110 psi. The upper limit of ethylene partial preSSure in the first reactor and the ethylene partial preSSure 
 in the Second reactor are Set according to the amount of copolymer it is desired to produce in each of these reactors, 
 i.e., to achieve the Split mentioned above. It is noted that increasing the ethylene partial pressure in the first reactor 
 leads to an increase in ethylene partial pressure in the Second reactor. Generally, the ethylene partial preSSure roughly 
 doubles in the second reactor over the first reactor. The 
 balance of the total preSSure is provided by alpha-olefin 
 other than ethylene and an inert gas Such as nitrogen. 
 A typical fluidized bed reactor can be described as fol 
 lows: 
 The bed is usually made up of the same granular resin that is to be produced in the reactor. Thus, during the course of the polymerization, the bed comprises formed polymer particles, growing polymer particles, and catalyst particles 
 fluidized by polymerization and modifying gaseous compo 
 nents introduced at a flow rate or Velocity Sufficient to cause the particles to Separate and act as a fluid. The fluidizing gas is made up of the initial feed, make-up feed, and cycle (recycle) gas, i.e., comonomers and, if desired, modifiers and/or an inert carrier gas. 
 The essential parts of the reaction System are the vessels, an interreactor transfer System; a vent recovery System; and, 
 in each vessel: a bed, a gas distribution plate, inlet and outlet piping, a compressor, a cycle gas cooler, and a product 
 discharge System. In each vessel, above the bed, there is a Velocity reduction Zone, and, in the bed, a reaction Zone. Both are above the gas distribution plate. 
 A typical fluidized bed reactor is also described in U.S. 
 Pat. No. 4,482,687. 
 The gaseous feed Streams of ethylene, other gaseous alpha-olefins, and hydrogen, when used, are preferably fed 
 to the reactor recycle line as well as liquid alpha-olefins and US 6,248,831 B1 
 the cocatalyst Solution. Optionally, the liquid cocatalyst can be fed directly to the fluidized bed. The partially activated catalyst precursor is preferably injected into the fluidized 
 bed as a Solid or a mineral oil slurry. The cocatalyst completes the activation. The product composition can be 
 varied by changing the molar ratioS of the comonomers introduced into the fluidized bed. The product is continu ously discharged in granular or particulate form from the 
 reactor as the bed level builds up with polymerization. The production rate is controlled by adjusting the catalyst feed 
 rate. 
 The hydrogen:ethylene molar ratio can be adjusted to control average molecular weights. The alpha-olefins (other than ethylene) can be present in a total amount of up to 15 percent by weight of the copolymer and, if used, are pref 
 erably included in the copolymer in a total amount of about 1 to about 10 percent by weight based on the weight of the copolymer. 
 Several Steps can be taken, in addition to temperature control, to prevent agglomeration. The product discharge 
 line between the reactor and the product pot is often plugged up with chunks between intervals of product drops. A continuous purge flow of nitrogen or reactor gas in the line prevents the plugging problem. Also, coating the reactor 
 Surface with a low Surface energy material is shown to be beneficial to slow down the rate of fouling build up. In addition, control of the electrostatic level in the bed prevents Static induced particle agglomeration. Static can be adjusted 
 to a Satisfactory level by controlled use of reaction rate, avoidance of quick change of gas composition, Selective use of Static-neutralizing chemicals and Surface passivation with aluminum alkyls. 
 It is preferred to control the Static in the reactor System during Start-up. If the Static is not controlled, Static induced layers of catalyst rich fines can form on the reactor Surfaces. These fines may, in turn, induce localized hot spots and the formation of chunkS. Reactor Surface passivation with an aluminum alkyl minimizes the formation of fines layers. This passivation is accomplished by first building up the 
 aluminum alkyl concentration in the Start-up bed to about 300 to 1000 ppm based on the weight of the bed, and then fluidizing the bed with purified nitrogen or ethylene for 
 Several hours. At the end of this passivation period, the reactor is purged while maintaining the circulation, the 
 reaction conditions are established, and the reaction is kicked off by feeding catalyst into the system. If static still persists, additional purges or Selective use of Static neutral izing chemicals may become necessary to reduce the level of 
 Static. 
 The residence time of the mixture of reactants including gaseous and liquid reactants, catalyst, and resin in each 
 fluidized bed can be in the range of about 1 to about 12 hours and is preferably in the range of about 2 to about 5 hours. 
 The resin blend can be extruded into film in a conven 
 tional extruder adapted for that purpose. Extruders and processes for extrusion are described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,814,135; 4,857,600; 5,076,988; and 5,153,382. Examples of various extruders, which can be used in forming the film are a single Screw type Such as one modified with a blown film die and air ring and continuous take off equipment, a blown film extruder, and a slot cast extruder. A typical Single Screw type extruder can be described as one having a hopper at its upstream end and a die at its downstream end. The hopper feeds into a barrel, which contains a Screw. The barrel can be smooth, but is preferably grooved. At the 
 downstream end, between the end of the Screw and the die, is a Screen pack and a breaker plate. The Screw portion of the 
 extruder is considered to be divided up into three Sections, the feed Section, the compression Section, and the metering Section, and multiple heating Zones from the rear heating 15 
 25 
 35 
 40

 65 10 
 Zone to the front heating Zone, the multiple Sections and Zones running from upstream to downstream. If it has more 
 than one barrel, the barrels are connected in Series. The length to diameter ratio of each barrel is in the range of about 16:1 to about 30:1. The extrusion can take place at tempera tures in the range of about 160 to about 270 degrees C. and is preferably carried out attemperatures in the range of about 180 to about 240 degrees C. 
 The advantages of the invention are found in the high extrusion speed of the resin blend; the high bubble strength; and the high bubble stability. Thus, the blend can be extruded to thinner gauges at higher extrusion Speeds, par ticularly gauges of 0.5 mill or leSS. 
 In order to maintain a constant production rate, increases in ethylene partial preSSure are accompanied by decreases in the amount of catalyst fed. Consequently, catalyst produc tivity is increased, an additional advantage of the process. 
 Conventional additives, which can be introduced into the blend, are exemplified by antioxidants, ultraViolet absorbers, antistatic agents, pigments, dyes, nucleating agents, fillers, Slip agents, fire retardants, plasticizers, processing aids, 
 lubricants, Stabilizers, Smoke inhibitors, Viscosity control agents, and crosslinking agents, catalysts, and boosters, 
 tackifiers, and anti-blocking agents. Aside from the fillers, the additives can be present in the blend in amounts of about 0.1 to about 10 parts by weight of additive for each 100 parts by weight of polymer blend. Fillers can be added in amounts up to 200 parts by weight and more for each 100 parts by weight of the blend. 
 Patents and patent application mentioned in this Specifi cation are incorporated by reference herein. 
 Molecular weights are weight average molecular weights 
 unless otherwise noted. 
 The invention is illustrated by the following examples. 
 EXAMPLES 1 to 6 
 The catalyst precursor used in example 1 is manufactured in two steps. In the first step, 390 gallons of tetrahydrofuran (THF) is added to a solution preparation vessel to which BHT (butylated hydroxytoluene) is added as an inhibitor to prevent peroxide formation. Then, 62.5 pounds of aluminum 
 reduced titanium trichloride TiCl, or one part TiCl to 3 parts AlCl (by weight) and 150 pounds of magnesium 
 chloride (MgCl) are added. The mixture is heated to a temperature of 65 to 75 degrees C., and held for a period of 
 4 hours to dissolve. The Solution is filtered to remove 
 insolubles. Then, 220 pounds of Silica are charged to the 
 vessel. The silica is slurried with the solution and the slurry is pumped to a jacketed holding tank maintained at a temperature of 35 degrees C. 
 The Second Step involves Spray drying the above slurry. This is accomplished by continuously feeding the slurry to a spray dryer. Hot nitrogen is circulated through the drying chamber, and the THF is evaporated leaving the TiCl/Mg Cl/THF/silica complex as a solid powder. The solids are then dropped into a slurry tank pre-loaded with dry mineral 
 oil. The slurry tank is then rolled for several hours to produce the catalyst used in example 1. It is Similar to the 
 catalysts described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,376,062 and 4.293, 
 673. 
 A magnesium/titanium alkoxide precursor, which is a Solid reaction product, is prepared according to illustrative 
 embodiment II from U.S. Pat. No. 5,124,298 carried out on a Scale Sufficient to obtain 300 pounds of granular material. Analysis (average of two runs): 12.3 percent Mg, 7.55 percent Ti, 60.3 percent OEt, 0.93 percent o-cresol (Cl= 11.5 percent by charge balance). 
 The activated precursor used in examples 2, 3, 5, and 6 is prepared as follows: US 6,248,831 B1 
 11 
 To a 10 gallon Stainless Steel reaction/filter vessel are charged 1,892 grams of magnesium/titanium alkoxide pre 
 cursor powder together with 3.5 kilograms of hexane. Then, a solution of 3.9 kilograms of SiCl, and 713 grams of TiCl in 6.6 kilograms of toluene is charged at Such a rate (15 to 20 minutes) as to keep the reaction temperature between 25 and 30 degrees C. The slurry is then stirred for 30 minutes and filtered through an internal filter plate. The solids are washed by re-slurrying in 15 kilograms of a 50/50 (by weight) mixture of hexane and toluene, and are then isolated by filtration. In like manner, the solids are washed twice with hexane and dried under moving nitrogen. The yield is 2,472 grams of yellow powder. Analysis: 10.7 weight percent Mg, 9.82 weight percent Ti; and 36.2 weight percent Cl. 
 The vessel is recharged with 1,302 grams of the yellow powder and 5 kilograms of hexane. Then, 7.291 grams of 25 weight percent ethylaluminum dichloride in toluene are added at Such a rate (15 minutes) as to keep the temperature between 25 and 30 degrees C. Then, 1,175 grams of 1 Molar BC1 in heptane are added all at once. After stirring for 30 minutes at 25 degrees C., the slurry is filtered. The solids are washed once with 50/50 (by weight) hexane/toluene, then twice with hexane and dried overnight under moving nitro gen as above. The yield is 1068 grams of dark brown powder. Analysis: 10.7 weight percent Mg; 9.62 weight percent Ti; 2.38 weight percent Al; and 56.7 weight percent Cl. A polymerization Sample is prepared by Slurrying 1.0 
 kilogram of the powder in 2.57 kilograms of mineral oil. 
 Example 1 is a comparative example and examples 2, 3, 
 5, and 6 represent high density and medium density embodi ments of the invention. Example 4 compares the examples 
 2 and 3 resins with the example 1 resin. 
 EXAMPLE 1. 
 About 85 pounds of polyethylene having a melt index of 1.0 gram per 10 minutes and a density of 0.920 gram per cubic centimeter made with the example 1 catalyst are charged to a first reactor as a Seedbed. About 120 pounds of polyethylene having a flow index of 0.5 gram per 10 minutes 
 and a density of 0.940 gram per cubic centimeter made with the example 1 catalyst are charged to a Second reactor as a 
 seed bed. Comonomers are ethylene and 1-hexene. Both reactors are then purged with high purity nitrogen at 80 
 degrees C. for Several hours until the moisture content is below 10 ppm. Then, about 1500 cubic centimeters of 5 weight percent triethylaluminum (TEAL) in isopentane is 
 charged to each reactor and circulated for a period of 4 hours. TEAL acts as a moisture Scavenger. The reactors are then given 2 high preSSure purges with nitrogen, and the 
 conditions set forth in Table I are established in each reactor:

 Approximately 225 cubic centimeters per hour of 5 weight percent TEAL in isopentane are fed to the first 
 reactor and 130 cubic centimeters per hour of 5 weight percent TEAL in isopentane are fed to the Second reactor to Serve as cocatalyst. Then, the example 1 catalyst feed is 
 initiated at the rate of 7.5 cubic centimeters per hour using a slurry catalyst feeder. The ethylene partial pressure in the 15

 first reactor is manipulated to result in a production rate of 30 pounds per hour of resin. The H2/C2 molar ratio and C6/C2 molar ratio are manipulated in the first reactor to result in a resin with a flow index of 0.25 to 0.50 decigram per minute and a density of 0.927 to 0.930 gram per cubic centimeter. The Split in the resin exiting the Second reactor, i.e., the final product, is 60/40 (weight percent), i.e., 60 percent high molecular weight resin and 40 percent low molecular weight resin. This is accomplished by manipu lating the production rate of resin in the Second reactor, which is, in turn, accomplished by adjusting the ethylene partial pressure. The melt index of the final product is about 800 grams per 10 minutes and the density is about 0.963 per cubic centimeter. At a total production rate of 50 pounds per hour (HMW+LMW), a total of 1100 pounds of resin are produced. The bulk resin properties are set forth in Table II as follows. The bimodal product properties are given in the 
 Second reactor column.

 The Table IV results are approximately the same as recited above for example 1. Thus, the low molecular weight made in the Second reactor has a melt index of 800 grams per 10 minutes and a density of 0.960 gram per cubic centimeter. Approximately 600 pounds of resin are produced. The Split

 Approximately 1500 pounds of resin are produced in each of examples 1 to 3. 
 EXAMPLE 4. 
 Although the reactor conditions used in the examples are Somewhat different, the gas composition is adjusted So as to make products with Similar bulk properties. The product evaluations of the resins produced in examples 2 and 3, 
 however, result in films, which are Superior to the film produced from the resin of example 1. 
 Samples of the three resins are submitted for Size Exclu sion Chromatography (SEC) analysis. The SEC is per 
 formed with a WatersTM 150° C. analyzer with trichloroben Zene as Solvent at 140 degrees C. With a broad molecular weight distribution Standard and broad molecular weight 
 distribution calibration method. 
 Example 1: Mn=13,848 
 Mw-283,537 
 PDI-20.47 
 Examples 2 and 3: Mn=12,179 
 Mw-333,221 
 PDI-27.36 US 6,248,831 B1 
 15 
 The SECs reveal that the examples 2 and 3 products have 
 a broader molecular weight distribution than the example 1 
 product. It is noted that the broadening occurs in the high 
 molecular weight component. This is considered to be very 
 beneficial for bubble stability. 
 The resin Samples from examples 1 to 3 are compounded 
 on a LCM-100 line (Long Continuous Mixer/Gear Pump Pelletizing System (LCM-100 G) from Kobe Steel, Ltd. The 
 mixer is fitted with EL-2 type rotors from Same manufac 
 turer. Granular resin and additives are fed at room tempera 
 ture under controlled oxygen level at feed and vent ports. 
 The unit is typically run at 220 rpm, 10 to 40 percent gate 
 opening and mixer barrel temperature control). Precautions are taken to eliminate the possibility of tailoring (oxidative degradation) during the compounding step. The com 
 pounded resin Samples are then extruded in a 50 millimeter 
 Alpine TM film extruder having an 80 millimeter die and a 1.0 
 millimeter die gap, and evaluated. 
 The example 1 resin Sample runs at a maximum line Speed 
 of 105 feet per minute. The bubble is not stable at higher line Speeds and collapses. The dart impact Strength of this Sample 
 is measured at 240 grams on a 1 mil film. The film cannot be down gauged to 0.5 mill because of inferior bubble stability. These results verify that the precautions taken to avoid tailoring are adequate. 
 The examples 2 and 3 resin Samples demonstrate signifi cantly improved film properties. These samples run at a 
 maximum line Speed of 240 feet per minute. This represents 
 a 130 percent increase in bubble stability. The dart impact Strength of these Samples is measured at 290 grams on a 1 
 mil film. The film is Strong enough to be down gauged to 0.5 
 mil, and the dart impact Strength at 0.5 mil is measured at 305 grams. Both Samples result in Similar product proper 
 ties. 
 The Film Appearance Rating (FAR) is also very good, 
 ranging from plus 20 to plus 40, for the examples 2 and 3 resin samples and for the MDHMW (medium density, high molecular weight) resin Samples of example 5. Tensile Strength, Elmendorf tear, and percent elongation are also improved. 
 EXAMPLE 5 
 The catalyst of examples 2 and 3 is also used to produce two medium density high molecular weight film products. 
 The reactor conditions and proceSS control methodology are 
 Similar to that used above for examples 2 and 3 except that adjustments are made in order to produce medium density 
 resins as opposed to high density resins, and the results are 
 Similar also. 
 The two MDHMW resin samples also demonstrate sig nificantly improved film properties. These samples exhibit 
 maximum line Speeds greater than 325 feet per Second representing a greater than 210 percent increase in line Speed 
 over the example 1 resin Sample. The dart impact Strength of 
 these samples at 0.8 and 0.35 mil are 470 grams and 376 grams, respectively, resulting in a normalized dart impact 
 strength of 599 and 1069 grams, respectively, at 1 mil. 
 EXAMPLE 6 
 The following are the conditions and properties for four 
 runs in which MDHMW resins are made. The catalyst is the Same as the one used in examples 2, 3, and 5. See Tables IX, 
 X, XI, and XII. 1O

 Notes to above Tables: 
 1. Resin properties for Second reactor: These are theo retical values based on the assumption that the Second reactor copolymer is produced independently. In Some cases the bimodal resin properties are given, i.e., the properties of 
 the resin blend. 2. Density is measured by producing a plaque in accor dance with ASTM D-1928, procedure C, and then testing as is via ASTM D-1505. The density is reported in gram per 
 cubic centimeter. 3. production rate (lbS/hr)=the average resin production rate per hour based on a heat balance calculation (approximately equal to drum average production rate). 4.5% TEAL=5 weight percent triethylaluminum and 95 weight percent isopentane. 
 5. titanium split (%)=residual ppm Ti in Second reactor resin divided by residual ppm Ti in first reactor resin. This is an indirect measure of polymer Split. 6. SGV (ft/sec)=Superficial gas velocity in the bed. 
 7. The fluidized and settled bulk densities of each of the resins (not the blend) is given in pounds per cubic foot. 8. tap blowback=nitrogen is used to purge (blowback) the taps to avoid tap pluggage problems. 9. STY (Ibs/hr/cu ft)=Space/time/yield. This is equal to the resin production rate divided by the bed volume. 10. Split (energy balance)=production rate in first reactor 
 divided by the total production rate. The instantaneous production rate in each reactor is calculated by a heat 
 balance on the reactor. 
 12. Dart Drop is determined under ASTM D-1709, pro 
 cedure A. 
 13. Line Speed is the take off speed from an Alpine TM film 
 line equipped with a 100 millimeter die and a 1 millimeter die gap. The film is produced in stalk mode with a 4:1 BUR (blow-up ratio) and a 6 to 8 times die diameter frost line height at about 45 kilograms output rate per hour.

About 120 pounds of polyethylene having a flow index of 0.5 gram per 10 minutes and a density of 0.940 gram per cubic centimeter made with the example 1 catalyst are charged to a Second reactor as a seed bed. Comonomers are ethylene and 1-hexene. Both reactors are then purged with high purity nitrogen at 80 degrees C. for Several hours until the moisture content is below 10 ppm. Then, about 1500 cubic centimeters of 5 weight percent triethylaluminum (TEAL) in isopentane is charged to each reactor and circulated for a period of 4 hours. TEAL acts as a moisture Scavenger. The reactors are then given 2 high preSSure purges with nitrogen, and the conditions set forth in Table I are established in each reactor:\\nTABLE I\\nreactor first reactor second reactor\\ntemperature (C.) 85 110\\npressure (psia) 300 345\\nC2 partial pressure 25 70 (psi)\\nH2/C2 molar ratio 0.04 180\\nC6, C2 molar ratio 0.027 0.0075\\nisopentane (mol%) 12\\ngas velocity (ft/sec) 1.75 1.70\\nApproximately 225 cubic centimeters per hour of 5 weight percent TEAL in isopentane are fed to the first reactor and 130 cubic centimeters per hour of 5 weight percent TEAL in isopentane are fed to the Second reactor to Serve as cocatalyst. Then, the example 1 catalyst feed is initiated at the rate of 7.5 cubic centimeters per hour using a slurry catalyst feeder. The ethylene partial pressure in the first reactor is manipulated to result in a production rate of 30 pounds per hour of resin. The H2/C2 molar ratio and C6/C2 molar ratio are manipulated in the first reactor to result in a resin with a flow index of 0.25 to 0.50 decigram per minute and a density of 0.927 to 0.930 gram per cubic centimeter. The Split in the resin exiting the Second reactor, i.e., the final product, is 60/40 (weight percent), i.e., 60 percent high molecular weight resin and 40 percent low molecular weight resin. This is accomplished by manipulating the production rate of resin in the Second reactor, which is, in turn, accomplished by adjusting the ethylene partial pressure. The melt index of the final product is about 800 grams per 10 minutes and the density is about 0.963 per cubic centimeter. At a total production rate of 50 pounds per hour (HMW+LMW), a total of 1100 pounds of resin are produced. The bulk resin properties are set forth in Table II as follows.

About 120 pounds of polyethylene having a flow index of 0.5 gram per 10 minutes and a density of 0.940 gram per cubic centimeter made with the example 1 catalyst are charged to a Second reactor as a seed bed. Comonomers are ethylene and 1-hexene. Both reactors are then purged with high purity nitrogen at 80 degrees C. for Several hours until the moisture content is below 10 ppm. Then, about 1500 cubic centimeters of 5 weight percent triethylaluminum (TEAL) in isopentane is charged to each reactor and circulated for a period of 4 hours. TEAL acts as a moisture Scavenger. The reactors are then given 2 high preSSure purges with nitrogen, and the conditions set forth in Table I are established in each reactor:\nTABLE I\nreactor first reactor second reactor\ntemperature (C.) 85 110\npressure (psia) 300 345\nC2 partial pressure 25 70 (psi)\nH2/C2 molar ratio 0.04 180\nC6, C2 molar ratio 0.027 0.0075\nisopentane (mol%) 12\ngas velocity (ft/sec) 1.75 1.70\nApproximately 225 cubic centimeters per hour of 5 weight percent TEAL in isopentane are fed to the first reactor and 130 cubic centimeters per hour of 5 weight percent TEAL in isopentane are fed to the Second reactor to Serve as cocatalyst. Then, the example 1 catalyst feed is initiated at the rate of 7.5 cubic centimeters per hour using a slurry catalyst feeder. The ethylene partial pressure in the first reactor is manipulated to result in a production rate of 30 pounds per hour of resin. The H2/C2 molar ratio and C6/C2 molar ratio are manipulated in the first reactor to result in a resin with a flow index of 0.25 to 0.50 decigram per minute and a density of 0.927 to 0.930 gram per cubic centimeter. The Split in the resin exiting the Second reactor, i.e., the final product, is 60/40 (weight percent), i.e., 60 percent high molecular weight resin and 40 percent low molecular weight resin. This is accomplished by manipulating the production rate of resin in the Second reactor, which is, in turn, accomplished by adjusting the ethylene partial pressure. The melt index of the final product is about 800 grams per 10 minutes and the density is about 0.963 per cubic centimeter.

The product evaluations of the resins produced in examples 2 and 3, however, result in films, which are Superior to the film produced from the resin of example 1.\nSamples of the three resins are submitted for Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC) analysis.

The bubble is not stable at higher line Speeds and collapses. The dart impact Strength of this Sample is measured at 240 grams on a 1 mil film. The film cannot be down gauged to 0.5 mill because of inferior bubble stability.

 POLYMERIZATION CATALYST AND METHOD 
 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 
 In this invention, the polymerization catalysts useful in polymerizing and copolymerizing 1-olefins are pre 
 pared by the reaction of silica or alumina with a func tional silane compound, organomagnesium compound, 
 an alcohol, and a titanium, vanadium, zirconium or mixture of these compounds. These catalysts are then activated, associating them with an organoaluminum cocatalyst. These catalyst products are primarily useful for the polymerization of 1-olefins such as ethylene and the copolymerization of these 1-olefins. One of the features of the invention is to provide an improved method of polymerizing with these catalysts in the particle form slurry, gas phase or solution form polymerization processes. 
 Another feature of the invention is that the polymeri zation reactions promoted by the improved catalysts are more readily modified by hydrogen so that desirable high melt index polymers are easily made. A further feature is that the higher melt index poly mers so produced are narrow in molecular weight dis tribution and are therefore highly suitable for injection molding or cast film applications. 
 Yet another feature of the invention is to provide a catalyst yielding high melt index, high density polyeth 
 ylene in the particle form process without reactor foul 
 1ng. 
 Still another feature of this invention is the produc tion of ethylene-1-alkene copolymers, commonly 
 known as linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), by the catalyst of this invention. These copolymers can have densities from 0.915 to 0.960 g/cm3 and properties suitable for film and injection molding applications, for example.

Ziegler first discovered two component catalysts based on compounds of the Group IVB-VIIB metals of the periodic table and an organometallic compound belonging to Groups I-IIIA of the periodic table for the polymerization of olefins. Since his discovery, numer ous catalysts have been disclosed as improvements over the original Ziegler catalysts. Most of these catalyst systems are of relatively low activity and stability. They require a costly catalyst removal step. 
 One of the modifications attempted in an effort to increase the activity of the Ziegler type catalyst was to deposit the catalyst components on an inert support. In 
 U.S. Pat. No. 2,981,725, such a process is disclosed. The supports used were magnesium chloride, silicon car bide, silica gel, calcium chloride, etc. The activity of the catalysts disclosed in these patents 
 was still low. 
 South Africa Applm. No. 69/3534, 10/5/69 by Van Den Berg and Tomiers of Stamicarbon describes cata lysts made from organomagnesium compounds, alkyl 
 aluminum chloride compounds, and titanium com pounds which are increased in reactivity by the addition of alcohols. A support, or granular ingredient, is not 
 used, there is no separation of the solvent, and the use of a cocatalyst is not disclosed. German Offen. No. 2,721,058, 11/23/78, by Gunter Schweier et al. of BASF reveals a catalyst with a po rous inorganic oxide like silica or silica-alumina as a support. A solution of a reaction mixture of an alcohol, a titanium trihalide, and : a magnesium compound is 
 added to the oxide, and then the solvent (i.e. the alco 2 
 hol) is evaporated giving an intermediate solid product.

 num or silicon halide compound. The suspended solid component may be used as is along with an organome tallic compound as a cocatalyst. The suspended solid 
 compound can also be filtered, and washed prior to use, and for gas phase polymerization it can be coated with wax. The magnesium compounds are not alkyl magne 
 sium compounds but alkoxides and halides and other types of compounds. 
 Another Schweier patent, German Offen. No. 2,721,094 is similar to this one. It reveals that the silica or silica-alumina may be treated with an alkyl aluminum halide compound beforehand. 
 U.S. Pat. No. 4,110,523, 8/29/78, also by Schweier et al., covers a similar catalyst. In this case, the treatment with the alkyl aluminum or silicon halide solution is 
 eliminated. 
 U.S. Pat. No. 4,130,699, 12/19/78 by G. R. Hoff and Peter Fotis of Standard Oil Company discloses sup ported catalysts for vapor phase polymerization which 
 are made less active prior to feeding to the reaction vessel by treatment with alcohols, acetates, ketones, aldehydes, or esters.

 U.S. Pat. No. 3,647,772 by N. Kashiwa (Mitsuit Pet rochemical, 5/7/72) involves treating anhydrous mag nesium carbonate with polar organic compounds in

 None of the above patents disclose the method and products of this invention. 
 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 
 The catalysts of this invention are formed from four 
 reactive materials. One of the reactive materials is the 
 product formed by the interaction of an oxide like silica or alumina with an organic silicon compound. This 
 silane-treated silica or alumina is combined with an 
 organomagnesium compound, an alcohol, and a tita nium or vanadium compound. From the resulting reac tion mixture, a solid, free-flowing catalyst is separated. The catalyst so formed is activated by an organoalumi num compound. 
 This invention provides novel catalysts, methods of making them and methods of polymerizing and copoly merizing 1-olefins. These catalysts are especially useful for the polymerization of ethylene to high density poly ethylene, and for the copolymerization of ethylene with 
 1-olefins for the formation of medium and low density copolymers. These improved catalysts are highly active 
 and are well suited for the economical and energy effi cient particle form and gas phase processes. Specifically, the object of this invention is to improve the well known Ziegler type catalyst by the method of this invention. These improved catalysts can be easily adapted to the particle form or gas phase process plants. 
 Polymers made using the invention catalysts can have 
 high MI and narrow molecular weight distribution. Thus, polymers well suited for injection molding and 4,374,753 3 rotational molding applications can be manufactured. The catalysts of this invention are stable, particulate, 
 and easy flowing. . . . . - 
 The alcohol modification allows the production of higher melt index polymers in response to the addition of hydrogen to the polymerization reaction. The silane treatment, in comparison with catalysts prepared with 
 out the silane treatment of the silica or alumina, leads to polymers of more narrow molecular weight distribu tions. The catalysts of this invention surprisingly retain both of these good features and are thus superior for the production of high melt index injection molding resins by ethylene polymerization. A totally unexpected advantage of the invention cata lysts is that they can produce ethylene-1-olefin copoly 
 mers (so-called LLDPE, linear low density polyethyl ene), with melt elasticity properties suitable for the manufacture of high strength blown film. The catalysts of this invention yield polymers with high melt index values at relatively low hydrogen con centration in the polymerization reaction. Thus, less hydrogen is required to obtain a given desired high melt index. This affords a savings on hydrogen and gives a higher reactivity because higher concentrations of hy drogen decrease the polymerization rate. The catalysts 
 of this invention give a relatively narrow molecular weight distribution at a given melt index. A narrow molecular weight distribution is desirable in polymers used for injection molding and in cast film applications because better strength is obtained. In the copolymerization of 1-olefins and ethylene to form low density copolymers of lower melt index, the catalysts of this invention can produce products with superior melt elasticity which is associated with high strength blown film. The catalysts of this invention are made from a com bination of silica or alumina, certain organic silicon compounds, an organomagnesium compound, an alco 
 hol, and a titanium compound. The catalysts are acti vated by an organoaluminum compound. 
 The silica or alumina materials may contain minor amounts of zirconia, magnesia, or titania. For catalyst manufacture, it is preferred to have relatively finely 
 divided silica or alumina, which may be porous or non 
 porous. The organic silicon compound must have at least one functional group which can react with the surface hy droxyl groups of the silica or alumina, and by means of this reaction the organic silicon residue must be bonded to the surface of the silica or alumina or mixtures of 
 these. Prior to the reaction between the organic silicon compound and the silica or alumina, the silica or alu mina may be dried to completely remove the water at a temperature less than about 800 C. The drying may be 
 only partial so as to leave a small amount of water to catalyze the reaction of the organic silicon compound with the surface groups. Usually, it is preferred to at least partially remove the surface water from the silica 
 or alumina. The amount of organic silicon compound may be in excess of the reactive surface groups. In this case, the conversion of the surface groups can be made as com plete as possible, and the unreacted excess can be re moved by distillation at less than 200° C., at pressures less than one atmosphere if necessary, or by heating combined with purging with an inert gas. The reaction product of the silica or alumina with the organic silicon compound should not be heated above 300 C., since 5

 decomposition of the bonded silane groups may occur. The amount of organic silicon compound may be less than the stoichiometric equivalent of the surface reac tive groups. In this case, no removal of excess is neces 
 sary. 
 The alcohols that are suitable for this invention con tain only one alcoholic hydroxyl group per molecule, and only carbon and hydrogen atoms in addition to the one oxygen atom. Phenols or alcohols with the hy droxyl directly bonded to an aromatic ring are not suit 
 able. 
 The alcohol can be added to the silane-treated silica or alumina immediately prior to the addition of the organomagnesium compound. The alcohol can also be added after the organomagnesium compound. It must, however, be combined into the catalyst mixture before the titanium compound. The reaction of the alcohol with the catalyst ingredi ents can be conducted at temperatures between 15° C. to about 100° C. but about room temperatures is com pletely satisfactory. 
 The amount of alcohol is chosen to give an alcohol to magnesium ratio between 0.1 to 5. Ratios higher than 2 * give less reactive catalysts and are not normally desired. Ratios less than 0.5 normally do not result in a sufficient increase in hydrogen response. A ratio of about 1.0 is preferred. 
 The amount of titanium compound is normally less than the amount equivalent to the reactive surface groups. However, the amount of titanium compound can vary from 5% to 200% of that equivalent amount. Trialkylaluminum compounds such as triethylalumi num and triisobutylaluminum are excellent cocatalysts. Alkyl aluminum hydrides like diisobutyl aluminum hy dride can be used. Mixtures of organoaluminum com pounds are suitable. An example is a combination of triisobutylaluminum and diethyl aluminum ethoxide. 
 The amount of cocatalyst is not critical. The molar ratio of organoaluminum cocatalyst to titanium com pound in the solid, free-flowing catalyst can range from 0.1/1 to 100/1. Preferably, the ratio is from 1/1 to 10/1. Activation of the catalyst with the cocatalyst can be accomplished within the polymerization reactor by the simultaneous feeding of both components. Alterna tively, the cocatalyst can be added to the catalyst prior to entry into the polymerization zone. 
 DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED 
 EMBODIMENTS 
 The catalysts of this invention have higher melt index capability and reactivity than normal Ziegler catalysts. These catalysts are simple to prepare and in the pre 
 ferred method, are highly economical because of the lack of necessity of calcination, solvent washing, high temperature reaction, grinding, etc. In this invention, the silicon compound has one or more reactive groups for each silicon atom in the mole cule. One of these reactive groups may be consumed by a surface reaction. Then the attached silicon atom may have no reactive group or it could have some reactive groups. The remaining reactive groups can interact with the magnesium component of the catalyst. By such interaction, the polymerization reactions can be influ enced toward desirable properties in the polymer prod 
 ucts. The silicon compounds useful in this invention have the following structural formulae: 4,374,753 
 RSixn 
 where m is 1, 2 or 3, n is 3, 2 or 1, respectively, and the total of m--n=4, X is a group chemically reactive with the hydroxyl groups of the silica or alumina such as chloride, amide, alkoxide, phenoxide and the like. The invention requires at least one such reactive group. If more than one are used, they may be the same or differ ent. Examples of reactive groups are -F, -Cl, --Br, 
 -OCH3, -OCH2CH5, -NH2, -NCCH3)2, -N(H- )Si(CH3)3, -CH2CH2CH2Cl, -CH2CH2CH2NH2, -OCH2CH2OCH3, -O2CCH3, . . . and -CH2CH2CH2SH. The R group is a hydrocarbon group containing only carbon and hydrogen. It may be, for example, alkyl, phenyl, or alkenyl such as vinyl. 
 The silicas or aluminas that are suitable for this inven 
 tion may contain minor amounts of zirconia, magnesia, or titania. For catalyst manufacture, it is preferred to have relatively finely divided silica or alumina, which may be porous or nonporous. . 
 Prior to reaction with the silane, the silica or alumina may be dried to completely remove surface water at a temperature less than 800° C. The drying may instead be only partial in some cases in order to leave a small amount of water, or the drying can be eliminated en tirely depending on the structure of the organosilane compound. Usually, it is preferred to at least partially remove the surface water from the silica or alumina. 6 possible to make high melt index particle form polyeth ylene with less hydrogen and at a lower polymerization temperature. The molar ratio of alcohol to magnesium alkyl is 0.1-5, most preferably 0.5-2.0. 5 The Group IVB and Group VB metals that are espe cially useful in this invention include titanium, zirco 
 nium and vanadium. 
 * The preferred titanium compound may be selected from the following formulas: O . .

 TiXm(OR)(4-m) 
 5 in which m is 1, 2, 3 or 4, R2 is selected from alkyl, aryl, cycloalkyl, alkaryl, cyclopentadienyl and alkenyl, for example, ethenyl, propenyl and isopropenyl, each of 
 these groups having 1 to 12 carbon atoms, and X is halogen. When more than one R2 group occurs in the 20 titanium compound, the groups can be the same or different. Titanium tetrachloride is a preferred compound. The amount of titanium compound is preferably less than the amount equivalent to the surface reactive groups. 25 Nonetheless, this invention includes amounts of tita nium compound, which are from 1 to 200 percent of that equivalent amount. Following the reaction with the titanium compound, it is necessary to remove the excess solvent in order to For example, in the case of hexamethyl disilazane, a 30 have a free-flowing catalyst. In a preferred method, 
 controlled amount of water on silica catalyzes the reac tion of hexamethyl disilazane with silica. solvent is evaporated and collected. This results in es sentially no reactor fouling and increases the bulk den The amount of silane compound may be in excess of sity of the product. Even through evaporation is the the reactive groups of silica or alumina surface. When preferred method of solvent removal, filtration, centri this is the case, the conversion of the surface groups can 35 fuging, or decantation can also be practiced. be made as complete as possible. The unreacted excess of silicon compound can be removed by distillation at less than 200 C. at decreased pressure if necessary, or by heat and inert gas purging. The reaction product of the silica or alumina with the silane should not be heated above 300 C., which might lead to thermal decomposition of the bonded silane groups. The amount of silane compound may also be less than the stoichiometric equivalent of the reactive groups upon the silica or alumina. In this case, all of the silane compound may become attached to the surface so that no removal of excess is necessary. The organomagnesium compounds useful in this in vention are the alkyls or aryls of magnesium.or.its com plexes such as complexes with alkyl aluminum com pounds. The structural formulae of some preferred compounds are R2MgX1, R'2Mg and (R22Mg). AlR32 where R2 is alkyl containing 1-10 carbon atoms or aryl such as phenyl, naphthyl and cyclopentadienyl and n is 
 0.5-10. X is a halide such as chloride or bromide. Com plexes of organomagnesium compounds with organo 
 aluminum halides can also be used. The complexes may contain small amounts of aluminum or magnesium al 
 koxides. The amount of organomagnesium compound added 60 to make the catalysts of this invention is determined by the amount of titanium compound. Normally, the Mg/Tiratio is from 0.1 to 5, most preferably 1.0. The addition of alcohol to the catalyst preparation is before the tetravalent titanium compound but can be before or after the addition of magnesium alkyl. The catalyst of this invention has an enhanced sensitivity to molecular weight control by hydrogen. This makes it 45 
 50 The alkyl aluminum cocatalyst can be chosen from trialkyl aluminum compounds and alkyl aluminum hy dride compounds and their mixtures. The alkyl groups of suitable cocatalysts have hydrocarbon chains con 
 40 taining one or about ten carbon atoms and may be straight chained or branched. Triaryl aluminum com pounds may also be used but because they are not so readily obtained as the alkyl compounds, they are not preferred. Examples of suitable cocatalysts are triethyl 
 aluminum, trioctyl aluminum, tri(2-methyl pentyl )aluminum and diethyl aluminum hydride. Trisobutyl aluminum and diisobutylaluminum hydride are espe cially preferred. If needed, alkyl aluminum halides may be used along with the alkyl aluminum compounds 
 described above. 
 The cocatalyst may be fed to the polymerization 
 reactor along with the above-described solid compo nent in the same or preferably separate lines. The molar is ratio of the cocatalyst to the Group IVB and VB metal compounds in the solid component can be from 0.1:1 to 100:1 although the preferred range is 1:1 to 20:1. When using the catalyst according to the invention, at least one 1-olefin of the formula R6-CH=CH2, where R6 is hydrogen or a straight chain or branched alkyl radical having from 1 to 10, preferably from 1 to 8, carbon atoms is polymerized. Examples of such ole ...fins are ethylene, propylene, butene-1, hexene-1, 4 methyl-pentene-1, octene-1. 65. The polymerization may be carried out in suspension, solution or in the gaseous phase, continuously or dis continuously, at a temperature of from 20-300' C, preferably from 60-110' C., under a pressure of from   4,374,753 7 
 atmospheric to 10,000 psi gauge. It is carried out prefer ably under the technically interesting pressure in the 
 range of from 300-800 psi. The melt index of the polyethylene produced by the 
 invention catalyst can be controlled by methods known to the art such as increasing the temperature of poly merization or by the addition of hydrogen. These cata lysts show relatively high activity in ethylene polymeri zation and copolymerization. The polymers can be eas 
 ily blended with antioxidants and pelletized for com mercial use. High partial pressures of hydrogen can be used to yield very high melt index products. The catalysts are useful for producing polymers of 
 1-olefins of 2 to 8 carbon atoms and copolymers of these 
 with 1-olefins of 2 to 20 carbon atoms to form solid polymers or copolymers. 
 EXAMPLES 
 EXAMPLE 1 
 A catalyst was made with silica treated with hex amethyl disilazane and with the addition of n-butyl alcohol. A control catalyst was made without the addi tion of the alcohol for comparison. Davison Chemical grade 952 silica was treated with hexamethyl disilazane. A 2.6 g quantity of the treated silica was transferred to a dry, nitrogen-filled flask. The silica was stirred with a magnet bar for one hour while a flow of N2 was passed through the flask. Then 7.7 ml of dibutyl magnesium-triethyl aluminum complex 
 (Mg/Al=6.1) solution, 8.9 wt.% in heptane, 0.59 ml n-butyl alcohol, and 16.25 ml of heptane were added sequentially. The combination was kept at room tem perature, under continuous N2 flow, and stirring for 30 
 minutes. Then 0.36 ml titanium tetrachloride was 
 added, and the combination stirred an additional 30 minutes at room temperature. The flask was immersed in a constant temperature bath at 90° C. until the hep tane was evaporated and carried away by the N2 stream. The catalyst remained in the flask as a free-flowing, light-yellow colored powder. The catalysts were tested for ethylene polymerization 
 at 215 F. with 500 ml isobutane in a 1400 ml vessel. 
 Triisobutyl aluminum (TIBAL) solution in an amount of 9.2 mmoles per gram of catalyst was added for each test. The total pressure was 550 psig in each case. The following results were obtained:

 EXAMPLE 2 
 Another catalyst was made as described in Example 1 except that the proportions of magnesium compound, 
 butyl alcohol, and titanium chloride were increased relative to the silane-treated silica. In this example, the amount of titanium tetrachloride was 1.75 mmol per gram of silane-treated silica instead of 1.25 mmol per gram. The Ti/Mg and alcohol to magnesium ratios were kept equal to 1.0. For comparison, a catalyst was made in the same way 
 but without the addition of the n-butyl alcohol. O

 The two catalysts were tested in a 2 1 polymerization vessel. A 1000 ml volume of isobutane was pressured into the vessel as a slurry medium, and hydrogen was added to give a 100 psi pressure increase. During the polymerization tests, ethylene was fed as required to keep the total pressure constant at 550 psig. TIBAL at 9.2 mmoles per gram was the catalyst. The tests showed that the invention catalyst gave a much higher melt

 Another test of the catalyst of Example 2 was done in the 2 l pressure vessel but with only 50 psi hydrogen 
 added instead of 100 psi. This test gave an hourly catalyst reactivity of 5052 
 with the product having a melt index of 2.4 and an RD value of 3.6. Previously, a comparison catalyst had been 
 made in a similar way but without silane-treated silica. in place of the silane-treated Davison 952 silica, ther mally treated silica was used. The temperature of treat ment was 600 C. This comparison catalyst gave an hourly reactivity of 224.5, a melt index of 3.0, and an RD 
 value of 4.5. The RD value is a measure of molecular 
 weight distribution and was measured as described in the article in Polymer Engineering and Science, Vol. II, pages 124-128 (1971). The lower RD value of the poly mer produced by the invention catalyst shows the prod uct to be more suitable for injection molding applica 
 tions. 
 EXAMPLE 4 
 The two catalysts of Example 2 were tested for ethy lene-butene copolymerization in a 1400 ml pressure vessel. In each case a sample of the catalyst, a volume of 25 wt.% triisobutyl aluminum solution and 500 ml of isobutane were introduced into the polymerization wes sel. The amount of trisobutyl aluminum solution was chosen to give 9.2 mmol/g of solid catalyst. The tem perature of polymerization was 160' F. After the isobu tane addition, hydrogen was added to give a 50 psi increase in pressure. Ethylene and 1-butene were then metered in over a period of five to seven minutes. Eth ylene was added as required to give a total pressure of 
 350 psig while the amount of 1-butene added was ap proximately 22 wt.% of the reaction vessel contents. 
 The reactions were continued for one hour after the 350 
 psig total pressure was attained. During this hour an additional 15 g quantity ofbutene was added to replace the portion polymerized. 
 The results of the tests showed that the invention catalyst gave a low density copolymer with superior melt elasticity. The invention catalyst also gave a higher melt index and reactivity:

 EXAMPLE'S 
 A catalyst was made in the same manner as described in Example 1 except that a different magnesium com pound was used. A 1.8g quantity of hexamethyldisila 
 Zane-treated silica was combined in a nitrogen atmo sphere with 20 ml of heptane and 5.7 ml of abutyl octyl magnesium solution in heptane. The quantity of butyl octyl magnesium was 2.25 mmoles. The combination was stirred one half hour at room temperature, then 0.21 ml of n-butyl alcohol was added. This mixture was stirred for one half hour. A 0.25 ml volume of titanium tetrachloride was added as small drops from a syringe to form the catalyst slurry. The slurry was kept at room temperature for another thirty minutes, then the flask 
 was immersed in an oil bath at 100 C. The flask was 
 kept in the bath for 30 minutes at the end of which time the solvents had evaporated leaving a free-flowing 
 solid. 
 Another catalyst was made with the butyl octyl mag nesium solution in the same way except that the n-butyl alcohol was omitted. 
 The two catalysts were tested under identical condi tions as described in Example 2, in a 21 polymerization vessel with 100 psi hydrogen at 215 F. The results show that the alcohol catalyst gave polyethylene of higher melt index.

 EXAMPLE 6 
 This example shows the use of another magnesium compound. A catalyst was prepared with the addition of n-butyl alcohol in the same way as the catalyst of Example 5 except that a dibutyl magnesium solution was added instead of the butyl octyl magnesium solu tion. The dibutyl magnesium solution was obtained from the Lithium Corporation of America. In this prod uct, a portion of butyl groups are secondary butyl groups and the remainder are normal butyl groups. A polymerization test was conducted as in Example 5 giving polyethylene with a melt index of 49 and a reac tivity of 1463 g/g cat. hr. 
 EXAMPLE 7 
 In this example, the molar ratio of the alcohol to the magnesium compound was varied. Three catalysts were made with the addition of n-butyl alcohol as described in Example 5 but with different amounts of alcohol. Also, in this case, butyl ethyl magnesium was used as the magnesium compound. The amount of butyl ethyl magnesium solution for each of the three catalysts was 1.25 mmoles per gram of the hexamethyldisilazane 
 treated silica. The amount of titanium tetrachloride was 
 also 1.25 mmoles per gram in each case. However, the volume of n-butyl alcohol added was varied as shown 10

 EXAMPLE 8 
 This example shows the preparation of a catalyst with aMg/Tiatomic ratio of 0.5 instead of the Mg/Tiatomic ratio of 1.0 in previous examples. The procedure for preparation was the same as in Example 5, and butyl ethyl magnesium was the magnesium compound. A 2.1 
 g quantity of the silane-treated silica was transferred to the dry, N2-purged flask. A 20 ml volume of heptane and 1.91 ml of the butyl ethyl magnesium solution were combined with the silica. With reaction periods as in Example 5, 0.11 ml n-butyl alcohol and 0.29 ml of tita nium tetrachloride were added. The solvent was evapo rated by heating at 100° C. for 50 minutes. In the poly merization test at 215 F. with 100 psi H2, polyethylene with a melt index of 36 was produced. The reactivity of the catalyst was 2471 g/g cat. hr. TIBAL solution at 9.2 mmoles per gram of catalyst was again employed as the cocatalyst. 
 EXAMPLE 9 
 This example shows that the magnesium to titanium atomic ratio can be greater than 1.0 in the invention catalyst. The procedure and ingredients were the same as in Example 8 but the Mg/Tiatomic ratio was 1.5, the butyl ethyl magnesium to n-butyl alcohol molar ratio 
 was 1.0, and the titanium tetrachloride was 1.25 mmoles per gram of silane-treated silica. The catalyst was tested for the synthesis of a 1 butene-ethylene copolymer as described in Example 4. 
 The reactivity was found to be 4364 g/g cat. hr. The melt index of the product was 2.9 and its density was 0.927. 
 The catalyst was also tested in the particle form syn thesis of polyethylene as described in Example 2. The melt index of the homopolymer was 57, and the reactiv ity of the catalyst under the given conditions was 1917 g/g cat. hr. 
 EXAMPLE 10 
 A catalyst was prepared as in Example 1 except that benzyl alcohol was added to the preparation instead of butyl alcohol. The catalyst was tested in ethylene butene copolymerization as described in Example 2. The catalyst reactivity was 1321 g/g cat. per hour, and 
 the melt index was 2.6. 
 EXAMPLE 11 
 A quantity of Davison Chemical Company grade 952 
 silica was first dried at 300 C. in a bed fluidized by nitrogen. A 1.3 g quantity of the dried silica was trans ferred to a flask, and combined with 15 ml hexane and 0.24 ml of allyldimethylchlorosilane. The amount of allyldimethylchlorosilane was 1.25 mmoles per gram of 
 silica. The combination was stirred in an inert atmo 
 sphere at room temperature for 30 minutes. At this 4,374,753 
stage, volatile materials were evaporated in a nitrogen 11 
stream by immersing the flaskin a bath at 100° C. Upon cooling, 15 ml hexane and 3.9 ml of dibutyl magnesium triethylaluminum complex solution (Mg/Al=6.1) were 
 added. After 30 minutes, 0.15 ml of n-butyl alcohol was added. The molar ratio of alcohol to dibutyl magnesium 
 was calculated to be 1.0. After an additional 30 minutes, 
 0.13 ml of titanium tetrachloride was added. The sol 
 vents were evaporated in a nitrogen stream at 100 C. The dry catalyst was white. 
 The catalyst was tested with triisobutyl aluminum cocatalyst in ethylene-butene copolymerization as de 
 scribed in Example 2. The reactivity was 2735 g/g cat. per hour, the melt index was 4.8, and the density was 
 0.919. 
 This example shows that allyldimethyl chlorosilane can be the silane compound. 
 EXAMPLE 12 
 The catalyst of Example 11 was tested in ethylene hexene copolymerization. The procedure was similar to 
 that described in Example 2. Instead of about 22 wt.% 
 butene, about 26 wt.% 1-hexane was added. Also, in stead of a total pressure of 350 psig, the pressure in this test was 300 psig. The product was recovered as particles. Its melt index was 6.5, and its density was 0.924. The catalyst reactivity was 2095 g/g cat. per hour. This example shows that low density ethylene-hexene 
 copolymers can be made with the catalyst of this inven

 copolymer had a density of 0.919 and a melt index of 40 3.1. The reactivity was 2832 g/g cat. per hour. 
 EXAMPLE 14 
 Again, a catalyst was made as in Example 11, but with a different silane compound. The silane compound was N,O-bis-(trimethylsilyl)acetamide. In an ethylene 
 butene copolymerization test like Example 2, the reac 
 tivity was found to be 2010 g/g cat. per hour. 
 EXAMPLE 15 
 A catalyst was made as in Example 11, but with N trimethylsilyl diethylamine. In ethylene-butene copoly 
 merization, the reactivity was found to be 3351 g/g cat. per hour. 
 EXAMPLE 16 
 In this example the order of addition of the catalyst components is different. Davison Chemical grade 952 silica was treated with hexamethyldisilazane. Prior to catalyst preparation, this treated silica was heated at 100° C. for one hour in flowing nitrogen. To 2.0 g of the treated silica, 20 ml of hexane and 0.23 ml of n-butyl 
 alcohol were added. The combination was stirred for 30 minutes, then 5.94 ml of a dibutyl magnesium triethyl aluminum complex solution was added (Mg/Al=6.1). The concentration was 8.9 wt.%, and the solvent was heptane. After another 30 minutes, 0.28 ml of titanium tetrachloride was added. The liquids were evaporated 45

 The temperature of the experiments was 160 F. for butene copolymerization and 155 F. for hexene copoly merization. For butene copolymerizations, the total pressure was 350 psig, and for hexene copolymeriza tion, it was 300 psig, Hydrogen to give a 50 psi increase in pressure was added to the isobutane, which was the 
 solvent in each test.

 0001. The present invention relates to a solid catalyst component for ethylene polymerization and copolymeriza 
 tion, composed of a carrier of particulate silica and a catalytically active portion including titanium, magnesium, 
 chlorine, alkoxy groups and at least one organometallic 
 compound of the groups 1, 2, 12 or 13 of the periodic table. The process for obtaining the catalyst of the present inven 
 tion comprises the steps of 
 0002 (a) impregnating an activated silica In particles using a solution of an organometallic compound of the 
 groups 1, 2, 12 or 13 of the periodic table, in an inert organic solvent; 
 0003) (b) removing the supernatant liquid from the step 
 (a): 
 0004 (c) preparing a solution obtained by reacting at least one magnesium compound, selected from mag 
 nesium halides and magnesium alkoxides and at least 
 one titanium compound selected from titanium alkox ides and titanium halogen alkoxides; 
 0005 (d) impregnating the silica obtained on (b) using 
 the solution prepared in (c); 
 0006 (e) optionally reacting the solid obtained In (d) with a reducing agent; 
 0007 (f) reacting the solid obtained in (d) or (e) with a halogenating agent; 
 0008 (g) treating thermally the solid obtained in (f); 
 0009 (h) washing the solid obtained in (g) with an inert organic solvent; 
 0010 (i) optionally, washing the solid obtained in (h) 
 with a solution of one or more organometallic com pounds of the groups 1, 2, 12 or 13 of the periodic table. 
 0011. The catalyst component obtained is especially suit able for the production of homo- and copolymers of ethylene 
 as narrow molecular weight distribution high density poly ethylene and linear low density polyethylene with controlled morphology and improved properties. 
 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 
 1) Polymerization Process 
 0012. The slurry or gas phase processes for the produc 
 tion of HDPE or LLDPE operating with low bulk density 
 polymer need reactors with large Volumes in order to obtain the necessary residence time. Particularly, in the gas phase 
 reactors the presence of fines with low bulk density causes 
 troubles. In fact, due to the friction of the polymer particles present into the reactor the fines are especially prone to the 
 formation of electrostatic charges and tend to deposit and adhere to the metallic walls. These stagnant deposits does 
 not allow the exchange of the reaction heat and become hot spots, which can form layer of agglomerates containing 
 eventually melt polymer. After some time chunks of agglomerates can fall down and plug the product discharge 
 system. The described effects are enhanced when the reac tion is carried out with a highly active catalyst. Jul. 27, 2006 
 0013. In the U.S. Pat. No. 5,410,002 a summary of patents on the above described phenomena is presented. 
 0014. Therefore, it is crucial for the process that the catalyst used enables a total control of the polymer mor phology resulting in product grains without fines, with high bulk density and good flowing properties. 
 0015. Another very important aspect is that the catalyst 
 must have a slow decaying time to permit the use of reactors 
 in series. This arrangement makes possible the obtainment 
 of bimodal products in addition the reduction of the total 
 volume of reaction for the same production basis. Moreover, process operation with a different condition of reaction in at 
 least two reactors in series, turns possible the use of catalysts with higher particle size thereby minimizing the formation 
 of electrostatic charges. 
 2) Polymer Structure 
 0016. The catalyst properties are fundamental to the polymer structure, mainly in respect of the molecular weight 
 distribution, comonomer insertion in the polymeric chain 
 and soluble content. 
 0017. Each application used to achieve a final product 
 from high density polyethylene (HDPE) or linear low den sity polyethylene (LLDPE) requires a specific polymeric 
 Structure. 
 0018 To obtain a film with improved optical and mechanical properties and avoid blocking problems, a poly 
 mer having narrow molecular weight distribution (MFR-27), is required. A large quantity of LLDPE appli cations requires products with density=0.918 and MI=0.7. 
 and in most cases a xylene soluble content<10% is desired. Indeed, when the xylene soluble content of the polymer is 
 present in a high concentration (>10%) and with a low 
 molecular weight, this soluble tends to migrate to the film Surface causing blocking, in addition to the unsatisfactory 
 optical properties (low gloss and high haze). 
 3) Ziegler-Natta polyethylene catalyst 
 0019. Due to the strong competition existent in the poly ethylene market, the catalyst production cost is a fundamen 
 tal component. Therefore it is mandatory that the catalyst for producing polyethylene be manufactured by a simple route, 
 from low cost raw material, without generating gaseous, 
 liquid or solid effluents hard to treat. 
 0020. The patent U.S. Pat. No. 5,188,997 describes a synthesis process for Ziegler-Natta catalysts from silica and 
 magnesium chloride alcoholate. The results reported dem 
 onstrate that this catalyst produces a polymer with low bulk 
 density (0.23 to 0.30 g/ml) and with an intermediate molecu 
 lar weight distribution (MFR 30.0 to 37.8). 
 0021. The patent U.S. Pat. No. 5,585.317 describes the synthesis of a catalyst Supported on a magnesium chloride 
 based carrier. The reported examples relates to the produc tion of polymers having good morphology, characterized by 
 the absence of fines and by the high bulk density which is for 
 LLDPE produced between 0.32 and 0.40 g/ml and for HDPE 
 between 0.33 and 0.438 g/ml. 
 0022. However, in the case of LLDPE production, the 
 polymer obtained presents an undesired comonomer distri 
 bution in its chain, evidenced by the high xylene soluble 
 content at different polymer densities. As an example, a US 2006/0166812 A1 
 polyethylene with 0.919 g/ml of polymer density has a 
 xylene soluble content of 12.5% by weight. 
 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 
 0023 The present invention relates to a solid catalyst component for ethylene polymerization and copolymeriza 
 tion, composed of a carrier of particulate silica and a catalytically active portion Including titanium, magnesium, 
 chlorine, alkoxy groups and at least one organometallic 
 compound of the groups 1, 2, 12 or 13 of the periodic table. 
 The process for obtaining the catalyst of the present Inven tion comprises the steps of 
 0024 (a) impregnating an activated silica in particles using a solution of an organometallic compound of the 
 groups 1, 2, 12 or 13 of the periodic table, in an inert organic solvent; 
 0025 (b) removing the supernatant liquid from the step 
 (a): 
 0026 (c) preparing a solution obtained by reacting at least one magnesium compound, selected from mag 
 nesium halides and magnesium alkoxides and at least 
 one titanium compound selected from titanium alkox 
 ides and titanium halogen alkoxides; 
 0027 (d) impregnating the silica obtained on (b) using 
 the solution prepared in (c); 
 0028 (e) optionally reacting the solid obtained in (d) with a reducing agent; 
 0029 (f) reacting the solid obtained in (d) or (e) with a halogenating agent; 
 0030 (g) treating thermally the solid obtained in (f); 
 0031 (h) washing the solid obtained in (g) with an inert organic solvent; 
 0032 (I) optionally, washing the solid obtained in (h) 
 with a solution of one or more metal-alkyl halide compounds of the groups 1, 2, 12 or 13 of the periodic 
 table. 
 0033. Therefore, the present Invention provides a catalyst especially suitable for the production of ethylene homo- and 
 copolymers as narrow molecular weight distribution high density polyethylene (NMWHDPE) and linear low density 
 polyethylene (LLDPE) with controlled morphology and improved properties. 
 0034 Additionally, the catalyst described and claimed in 
 the present invention produces a NMWHDPE with a melt 
 flow ratio (MFR) lower than 27 that are particularly suitable for thermoforming and injection applications. 
 0035) Further, the catalyst described and claimed in the present invention produces a LLDPE with a low xylene 
 soluble content due to the very good comonomer insertion allowing the production of films with Superior optical prop 
 erties and very low blocking. 
 0036) The present invention provides still a catalyst that 
 provides, when Submitted to polymerization conditions, particles of ethylene homo and copolymers having high bulk 
 density and containing a very Small quantity of fines. Jul. 27, 2006 
 0037. The present invention provides additionally a cata lyst useful in liquid phase or in gas phase, ethylene poly 
 merization process. 
 0038. The present invention provides further a catalyst useful in polymerization process due to its high activity and 
 low decay kinetics.

 1 to 20 hours. The amount of remained OH on silica surface 
 after this treatment ranges from 0.1 to 2 mmoles OH per g 
 of silica, preferably between 0.5 and 1.5 mmoles OH per g

 silica is directly used in the next step. 
 0059. According to the present invention, in step (c) of the process, a liquid component from the reaction between at least one magnesium compound, chosen from magnesium 
 halides and magnesium alkoxides and at least one titanium

 hours, preferably between 10 and 30 hours. The mixture comprising said compounds has to be prepared under tur

 0064. In general, when preparing the solution of the step 
 (c), titanium is used in Such an amount that the molar ratio Ti/Mg varies within the range of 0.3 to 4, and preferably 
 within the range of 0.5 to 2. 
 0065. In step (d) the silica obtained on step (b) is sus pended in an inert organic solvent, Such as a hydrocarbon 
 solvent of the aliphatic type, preferably the same used in the previous steps and the dissolved product prepared on Step (c) 
 is added to the Suspension. The impregnation is carried out by Suspending 100 parts by weight of silica, obtained on step 
 (b), for each 5 to 200 parts by volume of the component 
 prepared on Step (c) and after dilution in the inert organic 
 Solvent. The Suspension is maintained under stirring at a temperature that ranges from room temperature to the boil 
 ing point of the mixture, preferably at 60° C., over a period 
 of time from 30 to 180 minutes, preferably between 50 and 60 minutes. In this way a solid component Suspended in an 
 inert organic solvent is obtained. 
 0066. Optionally the solid component obtained in step (d) 
 can be submitted to reducing conditions in a step (e). Said result is obtained, for example, by using reducing agents, Such as Na-alkyls, Li-alkyls, Zn-alkyls, Mg-alkyls and cor responding aryl-derivatives, Grignard compounds of the 
 type RMgX, wherein R represents a linear or branched alkyl group, containing from 1 to 10 carbons or aryl-derivatives 
 and X represents a halogen atom and preferably a chlorine atom, Al-alkyl halide compounds or by using reducing 
 agents such as silicon compounds. Particularly effective silicone compounds are the polymethylhydrosiloxanes in 
 which the monomer unit has the general formula HSiR O— wherein R is H. halogen, alkyl with I to 10 carbon 
 atoms, aryl with 6 to 10 carbon atoms, alkoxyl with 1 to 10 
 carbon atoms, aryloxyl with 6 to 10 carbon atoms or carboxyl wit 1 to 10 carbon atoms, and n is a degree of polymerization that ranges between 5 and 100. Specific examples of such polymethylhydrosiloxanes (PMHS)

 or aryl-silanes (RSiH, in which R is alkyl or aryl and X is a number varying from 1 to 3) and alkoxy-silanes or aryloxy-silanes (ROSiRI, in which R is alkyl or aryland 
 X is a number varying from 1 to 3). 
 0068 The reducing agent chosen from the above examples, preferably polymethylhydrosiloxanes (PMHS), is 
 added to the solid obtained in the step (d), dissolved pref erably in the same inert organic solvent used for the reaction Suspension. This addition is carried out slowly over a period 
 of time from 30 to 180 minutes, preferably between 50 and 
 80 minutes and the Solid Suspension is maintained under stirring at a temperature ranging from room temperature to 
 the boiling point of the aliphatic hydrocarbon used as 
 solvent, preferably at 60° C. 
 0069. The amount of reducing agent that can be used in step (e) corresponds to the amount ranging from 0 to 2 moles 
 per mole of titanium, preferably between 0 and 0.1 mole per 
 mole of titanium. It has been observed, in the experiments, Jul. 27, 2006 
 that the quantity used of this reducing agent can control the 
 amount of titanium fixed on silica at the final catalyst. 
 0070. In the next step of the process according to the 
 present invention, the Suspension obtained in (d) or (e), 
 which is still under stirring, is put in contact and interacted with one or more halogenating agents. 
 0071 Halogenating agents useful in the practice of the 
 present invention can be either liquid or gaseous materials, 
 pure or preferably dissolved in an inert organic solvent. Representative but non-exhaustive examples of halogenat 
 ing agents useful in the present invention are methylalumi num dichloride, methylaluminum sesquichloride, isobutyla 
 luminum dichloride, isobutylaluminum sesquichloride, 
 ethylaluminum dichloride (EADC), diethylaluminum chlo 
 ride (DEAC), ethylaluminum sesquichloride (EASC), SiCl, 
 SnCl4, HCl, Cl, HSiCl, aluminum chloride, ethylboron dichloride, boron chloride, diethylboron chloride, HCC1, PCls, POCl, acetyl chlorides, thionyl chloride, sulfur chlo 
 ride, methyl trichlorosilane, dimethyl dichlorosilane, TiCl, 
 VC1, CC1, t-butyl chloride, n-butyl chloride, chloroform, 
 1,1,1-trichloroethane, 1,1,2-trichloroethane, 1,2-dichloroet 
 hane and dichloromethane. 
 0072 The preferred halogenating agents are chlorinating 
 agents and of these SiCl, SnCl4, HCl, Cl, HSiCl, methyl 
 trichlorosilane, dimethyl dichlorosilane, t-butyl chloride, 
 n-butyl chloride, chloroform, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, 1,1,2- 
 trichloroethane, 1,2-dichloroethane and dichloromethane are preferred, most preferably SiCla. 
 0073. The amount of halogenating agent used in the step (e of the process corresponds to the amount ranging from 0.5 
 to 3 moles of halogenating agent per mole of titanium, 
 preferably between 1 and 1.8 moles of halogenating agent 
 per mole of titanium. 
 0074 The time necessary for halogenating Ti-alkoxide 
 and optionally Mg-alkoxide varies from 0.5 hour to 5 hours, 
 preferably from 1.5 hours to 2.5 hours. The temperature of the Solid Suspension halogenation ranges from room tem perature to the boiling point of the aliphatic hydrocarbon 
 used as solvent, preferably at 60° C. 
 0075 According to the present invention, in step (g) of 
 the process, the solid obtained in (f) is kept under higher temperature that depends on the inert organic solvent used. 
 0076. The time necessary for this thermal treatment of the 
 solid obtained in step (f) ranges from 0.5 hour to 5 hours, preferably from 3 to 5 hours. The ideal temperature for this 
 purpose depends on the organic solvent used and it can be 
 conducted from 60° C. to 120° C., preferably from 60° C. to 
 75° C., when hexane is used as the organic solvent. 
 0077. At the step (h) after the thermal treatment, the solid can be separated from the Suspension, for example by 
 settling and siphoning, filtration or centrifugation, washed 
 with an inert organic solvent, preferably hexane, and then dried. The washing temperature can vary from room tem perature to the boiling point of the aliphatic hydrocarbon 
 used as solvent, preferably at room temperature. 
 0078. Optionally, the solid obtained in (h) is washed with a solution of organometallic compounds of the groups 1, 2, 
 12 or 13. More specifically, in the optional step (i) the solid 
 obtained in step (h) is suspended in an inert organic solvent 
 Such as hexane or heptane, and it is put in contact with one US 2006/0166812 A1 
 or more organometallic compounds of the groups 1, 2, 12 or 13 of the periodic table, preferably metal-alkyl compounds 
 or metal-alkyl halide compounds belonging to these groups, 
 in special aluminum, magnesium, lithium and Zinc com pounds. Specific examples of these compounds are methy 
 laluminum dichloride, methylaluminum sesquichloride, isobutylaluminum dichloride, isobutylaluminum ses 
 quichloride, ethylaluminum dichloride (EADC), diethylalu 
 minum chloride (DEAC), ethylaluminum sesquichloride (EASC), tri-n-hexylaluminum (Tn-HAL), tri-n-octylalumi 
 num (TnOAL). They can be used concentrated or preferably 
 dissolved in the above organic solvent or in a different organic solvent chosen from aliphatic hydrocarbons. The 
 process is carried out at a temperature ranging from room 
 temperature to the boiling point of the organic solvent used 
 as solvent, preferably at room temperature, for a period of 
 time that can vary from 10 minutes to 24 hours, preferably 
 from 40 minutes to 5 hours. 
 0079 When using more than one organometallic com pound in the step (i), the different compounds can be fed in 
 the same solution or in individual Solutions, at the same time or in Subsequent additions. 
 0080. The amount of the metal-alkyl halide compound of the groups 1, 2, 12 or 13 or metal-alkyl compound of the 
 groups 1, 2, 12 or 13, used in the step (i) of the process 
 corresponds to the amount ranging from 0 to 3 g of the corresponding metal-alkyl halide compound of the groups 1, 
 2, 12 or 13 or metal-alkyl compound of the groups 1, 2, 12 or 13, per g of dry catalyst component obtained, preferably 
 between 0.05 and 1 g of the corresponding metal-alkyl 
 halide compound of the groups 1, 2, 12 or 13 or metal-alkyl compound of the groups 1, 2, 12 or 13, per g of dry catalyst 
 component obtained. 
 0081. The use of inert organic solvents, most specifically aliphatic hydrocarbons, in all process steps of the present 
 invention brings another important feature to the Solid catalyst component characteristics. The Solid catalyst com 
 ponent obtained is completely free of residual polar sol 
 vents, such as ethanol, and their derivatives in its final composition. 
 0082 The titanium amount that remains fixed on the solid catalyst component may reach up to 10% by weight, 
 expressed as the Ti metal content, and it is preferably 
 comprised between 0.5 and 2% by weight. 
 0083. The magnesium amount that remains fixed on the Solid catalyst component may reach up to 6% by weight, 
 expressed as the Mg metal content, and it is preferably 
 comprised between 0.3 and 3.0% by weight. 
 0084. The chlorine amount that remains fixed on the solid catalyst component may reach up to 20% by weight, 
 expressed as the C1 contents, and it is preferably between 5 and 12% by weight. 
 0085. The alkoxy amount that remains fixed on the solid catalyst component may reach up to 20% by weight and it 
 is preferably between 3 and 8% by weight. 
 0.086 The amount of organometallic compound of the 
 groups 1, 2, 12 or 13 that remains fixed on the Solid catalyst component may reach up to 5% by weight, expressed as the 
 metal contents, and it is preferably between 0.3 and 3% by weight. This organometallic compound of the groups 1, 2, Jul. 27, 2006 
 12 or 13 are metal-alkyl compounds or metal-alkyl halide compounds belonging to these groups, in special organoalu 
 minum, organomagnesium, organolithium and organozinc 
 compounds, pure or in mixtures. 
 0087. The particle size distribution of the solid catalyst component of the present invention is very close to the silica used as carrier and, as consequence, its average particle size 
 ranges also from 10 to 120 um. The solid catalyst component surface area ranges from 80 to 300 m/g and its pore volume ranges from 0.1 to 1.0 ml/g. 
 0088. The catalyst component of the present invention is Suitable for using in liquid phase or gas phase, ethylene polymerization process. The co-catalyst used in the poly 
 merization process is an alkyl-aluminum, preferably trim 
 ethyl aluminum or triethyl aluminum. The mass ratio co catalyst: catalyst in the polymerization process is between 
 0.5:1 and 6.0:1. 
 0089 An important feature is its ability to produce, when 
 Submitted to polymerization conditions, particles of homo and copolymers of ethylene with controlled morphology 
 having high bulk density and containing a very small 
 quantity of fines. This feature allows the use of this catalyst in a process where the catalyst can be fed directly into the 
 polymerization reactor. Particular forms to feed the catalyst are in dry bulk powder, in paste, in oil suspension or in 
 Solvent Suspension. As an alternative the catalyst can be prepolymerized with ethylene or propylene and optionally 
 with a comonomer before being fed into the reactor. 
 0090 Another important feature of the present invention 
 is its tolerance to the high electrostatic charges occurring in gas phase reactors. This feature helps to prevent the forma 
 tion of polymer sheets or agglomerates on the reactor walls. The good catalytic yield and the low decay kinetics observed 
 for the present invention, allows its use in most polymer ization processes, including processes operating in more 
 than one reactor in series. 
 0091. A further feature characteristic of the catalyst of the present invention is when using a microspheroidal silica as 
 Support the catalyst obtained has also a spheroidal morphol ogy and in consequence a polymer product with good 
 morphology and flowability is obtained. 
 0092. The catalyst component of the present invention is advantageously used in the polymerization of ethylene and 
 mixtures thereof with alpha-olefins CH=CHR, wherein R is an alkyl or cycloalkyl or aryl radical with 1-12 carbon 
 atoms because it has a high activity and low decay kinetics. In particular, it is used in the preparation of 
 0093. High density polyethylenes (HDPE, having a den sity greater than 0.940 g/cm), particularly with narrow 
 molecular weight distribution (MFR-27), including homopolymers of ethylene and copolymers of ethylene with 
 one or more alpha-olefins having from 3 to 14 carbon atoms. These products are particularly suitable for thermoforming and injection applications; 
 0094) Linear medium density and linear low density polyethylenes (LMDPE and LLDPE, having a density lower than 0.940 g/cm) most specifically very low and ultra low 
 density linear polyethylenes (VLDPE and ULDPE, having a density lower than 0.920 g/cm and as low as 0.880 g/m) consisting of copolymers of ethylene with one or more US 2006/0166812 A1 
 alpha-olefins having from 3 to 14 carbon atoms, having a 
 content of units derived from ethylene greater than approxi mately 80% by weight. These products have improved 
 properties due to the very good comonomer insertion and, in 
 most cases, they have also a narrow molecular weight 
 distribution (MFR-27). Hence the low xylene soluble con tents are obtained, allowing the production of films with Superior optical properties and very low blocking. The 
 LMDPE products are particularly useful for rotomolding applications; 
 0.095 Elastomeric copolymers of ethylene and propylene 
 and elastomeric terpolymers of ethylene and propylene with 
 minor amounts of a diene, having a content of units derived from ethylene comprised between about 30 and 70% by weight.

 Preparation of the Solid Catalyst Component 
 Example 1 
 0.115. In a 5 liter flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer and previously purged with nitrogen were fed 44 g (0.462 moles) 
 of anhydrous MgCl, and 330 ml (0.969 moles) of Ti(OBu). 
 This mixture was allowed to stir at 300 rpm and heated to 
 150° C. for about 12 hours in order to have the solids 
 completely dissolved, thereby a clear liquid product was 
 obtained. This resulting liquid was cooled down to 40° C. and under gently stirring at 150 rpm, it was diluted with 
 3200 ml of anhydrous hexane. Into this solution kept at 40° C. and under the same stirring, 250 g of the silica Support 
 were added. This silica was previously dehydrated and 
 treated with 19 ml (0.139 moles) of triethylaluminum 
 diluted in anhydrous hexane, for 50 minutes and at room temperature. Once the addition of the silica is completed, the 
 mixture was heated to 60° C. and kept at this temperature for 
 1 hour. Into this mixture, kept at 60° C. and under gently stirring, a solution consisting of 100 ml of anhydrous hexane 
 and 192 ml of PMHS (0.085 moles) was dropped into it over 
 a period of time of 1.5 hours. At the end of the addition, stirring was continued for 2 hours at a temperature of 60° C. 
 To this mixture a solution of 200 ml of anhydrous hexane 
 and 184 ml of SiC1 (1.606 moles) was dropped over a 
 period of time of 1 hour. At the end of the addition, stirring 
 was continued for 3.5 hours at a temperature of 60° C. The temperature of the mixture was then brought to 65° C. and 
 kept for additional 2 hours. After cooling the mixture to room temperature, the stirring was stopped to have the Solid 
 settled. The Supernatant liquid was removed, the Solid was repeatedly washed with anhydrous hexane and then dried at 
 60° C. under nitrogen flow thus giving 390 g of a reddish powder.

 Example 2 
 0.125. In a 5 liter flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer and previously purged with. nitrogen were fed 5.28 g (0.055 US 2006/0166812 A1 
 moles) of anhydrous MgCl2 and 39.6 ml (0.116 moles) of 
 Ti(OBu). This mixture was allowed to stir at 300 rpm and 
 heated to 150° C. for about 12 hours in order to have the 
 solids completely dissolved, thereby a clear liquid product 
 was obtained. This resulting liquid was cooled down to 40° C. and under gently stirring at 150 rpm, it was diluted with 
 3200 ml of anhydrous hexane. Into this solution kept at 40° 
 C. and under the same stirring, 300 g of the silica Support were added. This silica was previously dehydrated and 
 treated with 23 ml (0.167 moles) of triethylaluminum 
 diluted in anhydrous hexane, for 50 minutes and at room temperature. Once the addition of the silica is completed, the 
 mixture was heated to 60° C. and kept at this temperature for 
 1 hour. Into this mixture, kept at 60° C. and under gently stirring, a solution consisting of 100 ml of anhydrous hexane 
 and 23 ml of PMHS (0.010 moles) was dropped into it over 
 a period of time of 1.5 hours. At the end of the addition, stirring was continued for 2 hours at a temperature of 60° C. 
 To this mixture a solution of 100 ml of anhydrous hexane 
 and 22 ml of SiCl, (0.192 moles) was dropped over a period 
 of 1 hour. At the end of the addition, stirring was continued for 3.5 hours at a temperature of 60° C. The temperature of 
 the mixture was then brought to 65° C. and kept for 
 additional 2 hours. After cooling the mixture to room temperature, the stirring was stopped to have the Solid 
 settled. The Supernatant liquid was removed, the Solid was repeatedly washed with anhydrous hexane and finally dried

 prepare LLDPE as shown in FIG. 2. 
 0219. A fluidized bed gas phase reactor 1 with 45 cm of 
 internal diameter and 120 cm of reaction Zone height is fed by a dry-solid catalyst feeder 2. The bed of polymer particles 
 in reaction Zone 3 is kept in fluidized state by a recycle 
 stream 4 that works as a fluidizing medium as well as a dissipating heat agent for absorbing the exothermal heat 
 generated within reaction Zone 3. The superficial velocity of 
 the gas, resulting from the flow rate of recycle stream 4 
 within reactor 1 is 0.7 m/s. Stream 5, which contains the gas discharged from reactor 1, said gas having low monomer 
 contents, is fed to the Suction of compressor 6. The com 
 bined reaction and compression heats are then removed from recycle stream 5 in an external heat exchange system 7 in 
 order to control the reactor temperature. The composition of stream 5 is kept constant to yield a polymer with the required specifications. 
 0220 Make-up components are fed to the system at spot 
 8 So as to make up the composition of recycle stream 5. So, 
 make-up stream 8 will include the triethyl aluminum 
 (TEAL) that directly reacts in a ratio of 2 moles of TEAL per mole of catalyst. Also at the spot 8, propane is fed as the 
 selected non-reactive compound required to maintain the total pressure of the system. US 2006/0166812 A1

 0221) The polymerization catalyst is introduced as a dry 
 powder by a catalyst feeder into reactor 1 in a site within the 
 reaction Zone 3, close to the distributing plate 9 in a rate to 
 control the residence time of the catalyst. The reactive gases, 
 including ethylene and comonomers are introduced at the spot 10. 
 0222. The produced polymer is discharged from the reaction Zone through a discharge system 11 that provides 
 the recovery of the reactive and non-reactive gases, recy 
 cling said gases back to the recycle stream 5 at spot 12 and lowers the pressure of the discharged mixture of polymer 
 and gases at certain pressure for later conveying the pro duced polymer particles 13 for downward sampling.

 PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OFA 
 CATALYST AND CATALYST USED IN OLEFN 
 POLYMERZATION 
 The present invention relates to the preparation of a catalyst for the polymerization of ethylene and higher 
 1-olefins. 
 A process for the preparation of a catalyst for use in the polymerization of olefins has been described, in which organic alkali metal compounds are allowed to act on the hydroxyl groups of finely dispersed metal 
 oxides, for example silicon dioxide, and the reaction product is reacted subsequently with a metal halide selected from group VIIa of the Periodic system, espe cially manganese hexachloride (cf. U.S. Pat. No. 3,205,177). The solid obtained gives a catalyst suitable for use in the olefin polymerization when combined with a metallo-organic compound the metal of which is selected from one of groups I to III of the periodic system. These catalysts, however, have a low activity and produce only 1.4 kg of polyethylene per gram of manganese in 3 hours at a polymerization temperature 
 of 95 C. and under an ethylene pressure of 98 atmo spheres. 
 A further process comprises impregnating a solid 
 carrier, for example calcium carbonate, with an alumi num-organic compound and treating it subsequently 
 with an excess of titanium tetrachloride, whereby re 
 duced titanium trichloride forms a sediment on the 
 carrier (cf. British Pat. No. 927,969). Thereafter the excess of titanium tetrachloride must be removed. The 
 polymerization activity of the catalysts thus obtained, 
 however, is likewise so low that the residual catalyst must be removed from the polyolefin produced. Furthermore, there are known catalysts used in the polymerization of olefins, which are obtained by treat ing an oxide, hydroxide, carbonate or sulfate of magne sium or calcium with an aluminum-organic compound and subsequently reacting the compound obtained with 
 a mixture of halides of titanium and vanadium (cf. Ger man Auslegeschrift No. 2,140,326). In the preparation of these catalysts the aluminum-organic compound and 
 the transition metal compound of titanium and vana 10

 dium are used in an amount such that the separation of 45 an excess of these compounds may be dispensed with, but on the other hand, active catalysts for the polyolefin polymerization cannot be obtained when using as transi tion metal compounds solely titanium compounds. A catalyst, for example, which had been prepared by re acting magnesium oxide with aluminum triethyl and by subsequently treating the product obtained with tita nium tetrachloride yielded per hour only 19.5g of poly ethylene per 1 gram of titanium under an ethylene pres sure of 39 atmospheres. A secondary treatment of the polyethylene obtained was necessary for removing the 
 residual catalyst because of the discoloration of poly ethylene. 
 Finally a process for the preparation of supported 
 catalysts has been disclosed, in which an excess of a metallo-organic magnesium or aluminum compound is 
 allowed to act on silicon dioxide, aluminum oxide or a 
 mixture consisting of silicon dioxide and aluminum oxide having superficial hydroxyl groups and the reac 
 tion product is reacted, after the excess of said organo metallic compound has been removed by washing, with an excess of a halogen compound of a transition metal selected from one of groups IVa, Va or VIa of the 50 
 55 
 65 2 
 periodical system, and the excess of the transition metal compound is removed by washing with a solvent. By washing out the metallo-organic compounds of magne 
 sium or aluminum and the transition metals there are formed highly diluted solutions, which must be decom posed subsequently. As a consquence thereof, undesired 
 waste products are obtained, which are contained in the waste water (cf. German Offenlegungsschrift No. 
 2,109,273). It has now been found that a catalyst suitable for use in the polymerization of 1-olefins can be obtained by starting from the reaction product of silicon dioxide and/or a metal oxide with a Grignard compound as a carrier and a soluble titanium compound, which cata lyst gives high yields and allows a good control of the molecular weight by means of hydrogen without mak ing a separation of the excess of metallo-organic com pounds and/or of titanium compounds from the carrier 
 necessary. The present invention consequently provides a pro cess for the preparation of a catalyst by reacting the reaction product of silicon dioxide and/or aluminum oxide and 1. a halogen-containing magnesium-organic compound and 2. a halogen compound of a transition metal (component A) with a metallo-organic compound (component B), which comprises reacting a silicon di oxide and/or aluminum oxide having a hydroxyl con tent of from 0.5 to 50 mmols/g first with a magnesium compound of the formula RMgX, in which R is a hy droxarbon radical having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms and X is chlorine, bromine or iodine, in the presence of a diluent, in an amount of from 0.05 to 1 mol of magne sium compound per mol of hydroxyl groups of the carrier and reacting thereafter the solid reaction prod uct in suspension with a halogen-containing titanium (IV) compound of the formula TiX(OR))4-, in which n is an integer of from 1 to 4, X is chlorine or bromine and R is a hydrocarbon radical having of from 1 to 12 
 carbon atoms, in an amount of from 0.01 to 1 mol of titanium compound per mol of hydroxyl groups of the carrier, to obtain the component A. Suitable carriers are porous oxides or mixed oxides of silicon and/or aluminum having a specific surface of from 50 to 1000 m2/g, preferably from 100 to 800, espe cially from 150 to 650 and a pore volume in the range of from 0.2 to 2 ml/g, preferably of from 0.4 to 2, espe cially of from 0.6 to 1.7 ml/g. The particle size is in the range of from 1 to 500 am, preferably from 10 to 200 um, especially of from 20 to 100 um. The number of hydroxyl groups depends on the specific surface and the temperature of the preliminary treatment and is in the range of from 0.5 to 50 mmols preferably of from 1 to 20 mmols, especially of from 1.5 to 10 mmols, hydroxyl groups per gram of carrier. Several of these oxides are prepared especially for being used as a carrier of sup ported catalysts. They are commercial products. Prior to the reaction of the hydroxyl groups of the carrier with the halogen-containing magnesium-organic compounds the absorbed water must be removed by drying at a temperature of from 120 to 800° C., prefera bly of from 200 to 500 C. The number of hydroxyl groups (mmol of hydroxyl groups per gram of carrier) may be modified by said treatment at high temperature, whereby it is reduced with an increasing temperature. After drying the carrier is kept under an inert gas atmosphere, for example nitrogen or argon, with the 
 exclusion of air or water. 4,148,754 3 Suitable halogen-containing magnesium-organic compounds are compounds of the formula RMgX, in which R is a hydrocarbon radical having from 1 to 20, preferably from 2 to 10 carbon atoms and X is chlorine, bromine or iodine. These compounds are known as Grignard compounds and may be prepared, for example by reaction of metallic magnesium with a halogenhy drocarbon having from 1 to 20, preferably from 2 to 10 carbon atoms, for example an alkyl, -cycloalkyl-or aryl halide, in the presence of a nucleophilic solvent, for example an ether (cf. Organikum, VEB Deutscher Ver lag der Wissenschaften, Berlin, 1964, page 466). These compounds may also be prepared in a hydrocarbon in 
 the absence of an ether. Preferred magnesium com pounds are ethyl magnesium chloride, n-propyl magne sium chloride, i-propyl magnesium iodide, n-butyl mag nesium chloride, t-butyl magnesium chloride, phenyl and magnesium bromide. n-Propyl magnesium chloride and n-butyl magnesium chloride are particularly prefer 
 able. The Grignard compound reacts in known manner with the hydroxyl groups placed at the surface of the carrier at a temperature below 100° C. while splitting off hydrocarbon, with the addition of -Mgx to the oxygen of the hydroxyl group according to the follow ing equation: 
 - - 
 -o-it-oh -- RMgX -o-i-o-Mex -- R-H 
 -O -O 
 Consequently one mol of magnesium alkyl chloride is chemically bound per mole of hydroxyl groups of the carrier. The number of hydroxyl groups of the carrier may, consequently, be determined by volumetric or chromatographic analysis of the hydrocarbon formed or by retitration of the excess of Grignard compound. The reaction of the solid carrier with the Grignard compound may be carried out in the following way: The solid carrier is suspended in an inert diluent, the dissolved Grignard compound is added at a tempera ture of from -20° to 150° C., preferably of from 0 to 120° C., especially of from 20' to 100° C., and allowed to act on the suspension for a period of from 0.5 to 20, preferably from 0.5 to 10, especially from 0.5 to 2, hours. The proportion of Grignard compound and solid carrier is chosen such that from 0.05 to 1, preferably from 0.1 to 0.95, mol of alkyl magnesium halide is used per mole of hydroxyl groups of the carrier. The magne sium compound is applied on the carrier quantitatively in said process. The reaction is completed when no more magnesium can be detected in the supernatant 
 solution after the solid carrier has settled. 
 Suitable diluents are all solvents inert with regard to Grignard compounds, for example saturated hydrocar bons or ethers, for example pentane, hexane, heptane, diethyl ether, tetrahydrofurane, or mixture of both types of compounds. After completion of the above reaction the diluent is separated by filtration and drying or directly by distilla tion, at a temperature of from 50 to 200 C., if it con tains an ether. The separation of the diluent is necessary for removing the ether, which has been used for the preparation of the Grignard compound and formed a complex with said compound, owing to the fact that the ether also reacts with the titanium compound while forming a complex and deactivates the catalyst.

 The separated diluent may be reused after having 
 been recovered. The solid carrier impregnated with the Grignard compound is thereafter suspended again in an inert dispersing agent, preferably in an inert hydrocarbon. A dispersing agent conventionally used for the polymeri zation under low pressure according to Ziegler is 
 chosen preferably. When not an ether but a saturated hydrocarbon is used for the preparation of the Grignard compound, the 
 diluent need not be separated and the titanium(IV) com pound may be directly added to the reaction mixture. Suitable inert dispersing agents are aliphatic or cycloali phatic hydrocarbons, for example pentane, hexane, heptane, cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane as well as 
 aromatic hydrocarbons, for example benzene, toluene, 
 xylene, and furthermore benzine or Diesel oil fractions, which have been carefully purified of oxygen, sulfur compounds and moisture, may be used. To the suspension obtained there is added subse quently a halogen-containing titanium(IV) compound, at a temperature of from 20 to 140 C., preferably of from 30 to 130 C, especially of from 40 to 120° C. and the mixture is stirred at this temperature until a titanium compound can no longer be detected in the suernatant solution, generally within a period of from 2 to 20 
 hours. The halogen-containing titanium(IV) compound is a compound of the formula TiXn (OR)4-, wherein n is an integer of from 1 to 4 and X is chlorine or bromine and R is a hydrocarbon radical, preferably an alkyl, aryl or aralkyl radical having from 1 to 12, preferably from 1 to 8 carbon atoms, especially a straight chain or branched alkyl radical having from 1 to 8 carbon atoms, for example TiCl4, TiCl3, (O-n-C3H7), TiCl2(O-n- C3H7)2, TiCl(O-n-C3H7)3, TiCl2(O-1-C3H)2, TiCl3(O-i- C3H7), TiCl3(O-CH2C6H5), TiCl2(O-CH2C6H5)2, TiCl 3(O-i-C4H9) and TiCl2(O-i-C4H9)2. Titanium tetrachloride, TiCl2(O-i-C3H)2 and TiCl 3(O-i-C3H7) are used preferably. The proportion between the titanium compound and 
 the solid carrier is chosen such that of from 0.01 to 1, preferably of from 0.05 to 1, especially of from 0.1 to 1, mol of titanium compound is used per 1 mole of hy droxyl groups of the solid carrier. The proportion of, Grignard compound to the tita 
 nium compound is chosen such that the atomic ratio of magnesium to titanium in the catalyst component A is in the range of from 0.01 to 10, preferably of from 0.05 to 5, especially of from 0.1 to 2. The catalyst component A thus obtained is used ei ther directly in the form of the suspension or after re 
 moval of the diluent and drying. Suitable compounds for the component B are organic 
 compounds of the metals selected from one of the main groups I, II and III of the periodic system. Aluminum organic compounds are preferably used as component 
 B. Suitable aluminum-organic compounds are the reac tion products of aluminum-trialkyls or aluminum dial kyl hydrides, containing alkyl radicals having from 1 to 
 16 carbon atoms, with dienes having from 4 to 20 car bon atoms. The reaction products of aluminum trialkyls or aluminum-dialkyl hydrides, the alkyl radicals of 
 which have from 4 to 8 carbon atoms, for example phellandrene of a diene of the formula 4,148,754 
 wherein R2 and R2 is hydrogen, an alkyl radical, an alkylene radical having a non-terminal double bond or a mononuclear aryl radical and a is 0 or 1, are used prefer ably. There may be mentioned, by way of example, 1,4-butadiene, isoprene, 2-phenyl butadiene, 1,4-pen tadiene, 1,3-pentadiene and myrcene. The reaction products of Al(i-C4H9)3 or Al(i-C4H9)2H with isoprene are used preferably. They comprise, for example, com pounds of the formula 
 R3 
 Z-A-R-Y-Z 
 wherein Y means the groups 
 R3 R4 R4 
 -Al-, - Al- crA 1-, o / N A. N / R4 
 Z is hydrogen, the isobutyl group, the dihydroisoprenyl group or an oligomer of this group, R is the isobutyl radical, R4 is the tetrahydroisoprenylene radical and n is an integer of from d1 to 20, the compounds of the for 
 mula 
 Al-R-Y-R 
 wherein Y, R3 and Rand n are defined as above. The ratio between C5 and C4 radicals in the reaction prod ucts of A1(i-C4H9)3 or A1(i-C4H9)2H with isoprene may generally be in the range of from 0.25 to 10, preferably 1 to 4. A compound of this type being commercially available under the name ""aluminum isoprenyl' is used particularly preferable. Further suitable compounds for component B are chlorine-containing aluminum-organic compounds, for example dialkyl aluminum monochlorides of the for mula R52AlCl or alkyl aluminum sesqui-chlorides of the formula R53Al2Cl3, wherein R5 is a hydrocarbon radical having from 1 to 16 carbon atoms, preferably an alkyl radical having from 1 to 16, especially from 2 to 12 carbon atoms. There may be mentioned, by way of example (C2H5)2AlCl, (i-C4H9)2AlCl, (C2H5)3Al2Cl3. Especially suitable compounds for the component B are aluminum trialkyls of the formula AllR3 or alumi num dialkyl hydrides of the formula AllR2H, wherein R5 is a hydrocarbon radical having from 1 to 16 carbon atoms, preferably an alkyl radical having from 1 to 16, especially from 2 to 4 carbon atoms, for example Al(C2H5)3, Al(C2H5)2H Al(C3H7)2H, Al(i-C4H9)3, Al(i- C4H9)2H. The conversion of the titanium(IV) compound of component A into the polymerization active compound having a lower valency is advantageously performed during the polymerization by the metallo-organic com pound (component B) at a temperature of from 20' to 150° C., preferably of from 60' to 140 C. Component A may also be treated with a metallo organic compound prior to polymerizing and be used subsequently in the polymerization at a temperature of 10

 from -30 to 150° C., preferably of from 0 to 100° C., with a molar ratio between metallo-organic compound and titanium compound of from 0.2:1 to 3:1, preferably from 0.5:1 to 2:1. If a chlorine-containing metallo organic compound is used it is advisable to wash the reaction product obtained with fresh dispersing agent. Thereafter it is activated with a further metallo-organic compound at a temperature of from 20 to 150 C. When using the catalyst according to the invention at least one 1-olefin of the formula R6-CH=CH2, wherein R6 is hydrogen or a straight chain or branched alkyl radical having from 1 to 10, preferably from 1 to 8, carbon atoms, is polymerized. Examples of such olefins are ethylene, propylene, butene-1, hexene-1, 4-methyl-pentene-1, octene-1. Ethylene is preferably 
 polymerized alone or as a mixture consisting of at least 70% by weight of ethylene and at most 30% by weight 
 of a further 1-olefin of the above formula. Ethylene is especially polymerized either alone or as a mixture of at least 92% by weight of ethylene and at most 8% by 
 weight of a further 1-olefin of the above formula. The molecular weight of the polymer is controlled in known manner, preferably by using hydrogen. The polymerization may be carried out in solution, in suspension or in the gaseous phase, continuously or 
 discontinuously, at a temperature of from 20 to 150 C., 
 preferably of from 60 to 140 C., under a pressure of from 0.5 to 50 bars. It is carried out preferably under the technically interesting pressure in the range of from 1 to 
 40 bars. 
 Thereby the titanium compound is used in a concen 
 tration of from 0.005 to 1.5, preferably of from 0.05 to 1, mmol per liter of dispersing agent or reactor volume. The metallo-organic compound is used in a concentra 
 tion of from 0.5 to 10 mmols, preferably of from 2 to 6 mmols, per liter of dispersing agent or reactor volume. Higher concentrations are also possible principally. The polymerization in suspension or solution is car 
 ried out in a conventional inert solvent for low pressure processes according to Ziegler, which have been de 
 scribed above. 
 The process according to the invention has the ad vantage that excessive metal compounds do not have to be removed from the catalyst component A by washing, owing to the fact that both the halogen-containing mag nesium-organic compound used and the halogen-con taining titanium(IV) compound react completely with the carrier. Consequently, no washing liquids are formed from which the metal compounds must be sepa rated prior to the secondary treatment. As a conse quence thereof there are formed no metal-containing waste water or slurries. During the polymerization of ethylene and higher 1-olefins the catalyst according to the invention gives high catalyst yields under low pres 
 sure, for example of from 1 to 7 bars, such that the magnesium/titanium and aluminum compound may 
 completely remain in the polymer; a discoloration of the polyolefin or corrosion phenomena on the processing machines do not occur. Thus expensive operations such as a decomposition of the catalyst and a removal of the catalyst may be dispensed with. Carrying out the poly merization under a higher pressure permits use of a still smaller quantity of catalyst, as the catalyst yield is highly improved with an increasing polymerization 
 pressure. The catalyst according to the invention is especially suitable for the polymerization of ethylene in the gase 4,148,754 7 
 ous phase in a fluidized bed. The use of oxide carriers having a particle size of more than 30 Jum, which may be obtained for example by separating fine particles by sieving, prevents finely divided catalysts or polymer 
 parts from being carried out of the fluidized bed and forming deposits in exterior zones of the reactor. The catalyst according to the invention permits prep aration of a polymer, the powder in bulk of which has a high air permeability and thus may directly be used in the processing by injection molding or extrusion with out previous granulation. A good air permeability of the powder in bulk in the extruder feeding zone prevents an incorporation of air into the molten polymer, which 
 would cause a formation of bubbles in the finished part. The porous silicon dioxide having one or more sur face OH groups is designated as ""silicic acid' in the examples. For determining the number of hydroxyl groups of 
 the carrier 10.0 g of the dried silicic acid are reacted under an argon atmosphere while refluxing and stirring with a solution of 500 mmols of n-propyl magnesium chloride in 500 ml of diethyl ether, for a period of 4 hours. After settling of the silicic acid magnesium is retitrated in the supernatant solution by way of com plexometry. The titanium content of component A is determined colorimetrically by using hydrogen peroxide (cf. G. O. 
 Muller, Praktikum der quantitativen chemischen Ana lyse, 4th edition, (1957), page 243). For the polymerization in suspension there is used a hydrated Diesel oil fraction having a boiling range of 
 from 140 to 200 C. 
 The melt index of the polymer is determined accord ing to DIN (German Industrial Standard) 53,735, at 190° C., by using a load of 5 kg for is and of 15 kg for i15. The reduced specific viscosity (RSV) is determined with a solution of decahydronaphthalene at 135 C. at a 
 concentration of 1 g/b 1. The bulk density is determined by weighing 100 cm of polyethylene powder. The air permeability is determined in the following manner: 100 cm3 of polyethylene powder are placed in a graduated cylinder, which has an inner diameter of 3 cm and a fritted glass bottom, and air suctioned through the powder at a rate of flow of 4 l/h; the pressure de crease occuring in the powder in bulk is determined. The air permeability is then determined in the following 
 nanner: 
 height of the package X flow velocity air permeability (L) = diameter of the cylinder X pressure loss. 
 In the present invention L is 0.023/A p - 1, whereby A p is millimeters of the water column and 1 mm water column corresponds to the pressure loss of the glass frit. The diamension of L is (cm . . sec/g). All solvents are distilled under an inert gas atmo sphere having a purity of at least 99.995% in a circula tion apparatus while passing over benzophenone potas sium and are withdrawn under an inert gas atmosphere. The preparation of the catalyst and the polymerization of ethylene are carried out under an argon atmosphere or under an atmosphere of purified nitrogen while care fully excluding air and humidity. The following examples illustrate the invention.
