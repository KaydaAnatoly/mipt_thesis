	abstract = {The beginning and ripening of digital chemistry is analyzed focusing on the role of artificial intelligence ({AI}) in an expected leap in chemical sciences to bring this area to the next evolutionary level. The analytic description selects and highlights the top 20 {AI}-based technologies and 7 broader themes that are reshaping the field. It underscores the integration of digital tools such as machine learning, big data, digital twins, the Internet of Things ({IoT}), robotic platforms, smart control of chemical processes, virtual reality and blockchain, among many others, in enhancing research methods, educational approaches, and industrial practices in chemistry. The significance of this study lies in its focused overview of how these digital innovations foster a more efficient, sustainable, and innovative future in chemical sciences. This article not only illustrates the transformative impact of these technologies but also draws new pathways in chemistry, offering a broad appeal to researchers, educators, and industry professionals to embrace these advancements for addressing contemporary challenges in the field.},

	abstract = {Background The academic publishing world is changing significantly, with ever-growing numbers of publications each year and shifting publishing patterns. However, the metrics used to measure academic success, such as the number of publications, citation number, and impact factor, have not changed for decades. Moreover, recent studies indicate that these metrics have become targets and follow Goodhart's Law, according to which, ``when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.'' Results In this study, we analyzed {$>$}120 million papers to examine how the academic publishing world has evolved over the last century, with a deeper look into the specific field of biology. Our study shows that the validity of citation-based measures is being compromised and their usefulness is lessening. In particular, the number of publications has ceased to be a good metric as a result of longer author lists, shorter papers, and surging publication numbers. Citation-based metrics, such citation number and h-index, are likewise affected by the flood of papers, self-citations, and lengthy reference lists. Measures such as a journal's impact factor have also ceased to be good metrics due to the soaring numbers of papers that are published in top journals, particularly from the same pool of authors. Moreover, by analyzing properties of {$>$}2,600 research fields, we observed that citation-based metrics are not beneficial for comparing researchers in different fields, or even in the same department. Conclusions Academic publishing has changed considerably; now we need to reconsider how we measure success.},

	abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs) generalize well across language tasks, but suffer from hallucinations and uninterpretability, making it difficult to assess their accuracy without ground-truth. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models have been proposed to reduce hallucinations and provide provenance for how an answer was generated. Applying such models to the scientific literature may enable large-scale, systematic processing of scientific knowledge. We present PaperQA, a RAG agent for answering questions over the scientific literature. PaperQA is an agent that performs information retrieval across full-text scientific articles, assesses the relevance of sources and passages, and uses RAG to provide answers. Viewing this agent as a question-answering model, we find it exceeds performance of existing LLMs and LLM agents on current science QA benchmarks. To push the field closer to how humans perform research on scientific literature, we also introduce LitQA, a more complex benchmark that requires retrieval and synthesis of information from full-text scientific papers across the literature. Finally, we demonstrate PaperQA's matches expert human researchers on LitQA.},
