 from about 0.5 wt % to about 3.0 wt % of the silica seeding agent is used relative to the magnesium-halide compound. 
 Generally, a higher ratio of magnesium-halide to Silica 
 Seeding agent in the mixture results in a higher ratio of magnesium-halide to Silica in the catalyst Support formed and, consequently, a larger catalyst Support is expected to 
 form because more magnesium-halide crystalizes onto the Silica Seeding agent. 
 0.014. The solvent is added in amounts from about 2 to 20 times, preferably about 6 times, the molar ratio of the magnesium-halide compound to facilitate the liquefying of 
 the magnesium-halide compound at a lower temperature. 
 U.S. Pat. No. 4,421,674 to Invernizzi et al. teaches, for 
 example, that when the mole ratio of ethanol (“EtOH') to MgCl, is 102, the complex liquefies at 60° C.; at a mole ratio of EtOH to MgCl2 of 7.75 the complex liquefies at 80° C.; 
 at a mole ratio of EtOH to MgCl, of 6.51 the complex liquefies at 90° C.; and at a mole ratio of EtOH to MgCl, of 5.43 the complex liquefies at 100° C. The mixture is initially translucent due to the Suspension of the magnesium-halide 
 compound and the Silica Seeding agent. The mixture is 
 heated to about 60° C. to about 140°C., preferably about 80° 
 C. to about 120° C., until the solvent begins to reflux and the magnesium-halide compound goes into Solution, whereupon 
 the mixture becomes transparent, and the temperature is 
 maintained at the reflux temperature for about 0.25 hours to about 3.0 hours, preferably about 1.0 hour to about 2.0 hours, preferably with continuous stirring. It is possible to 
 form the mixture without either the oil or the Solvent, or by mixing the ingredients in a different order, but the above 
 described mixing operation has been shown to result in a well-dispersed mixture. 
 0015 The clear mixture, which includes a MgCl2.xEtOH complex (where X is an integer from 1-20), is rapidly transferred to a Second mixing apparatus containing a pre 
 chilled hydrocarbon Solvent, Such as heptane, hexane, cyclo hexane, or other aliphatic or cycloaliphatic hydrocarbon 
 which is miscible in the oil and which will not freeze at the 
 temperatures necessary for the Solidification of the MgCl2.xEtOH complex. The hydrocarbon solvent is pre 
 chilled, for example, to between ice (0° C.) and dry ice/ isopropanol temperatures (i.e., about -70° C. to -90° C.). The rapid temperature decrease causes almost all of the magnesium-halide compound to precipitate out of Solution 
 and crystallize onto the Silica Seeding agent, thus coating the Silica Seeding agent to form a catalyst Support. The catalyst 
 Support particles preferably include less than 10 wt % Silica, 
 preferably no more than 5 wt % silica, and more preferably 
 no more than 3 wt % Silica. 
 0016. After about 0.5 to 2 hours, preferably about 1 hour, 
 the mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature and it is filtered. Approximately Spherical and/or Spheroidal Solid 
 catalyst Support particles, each comprising at least one Silica Seeding agent with magnesium-halide crystals attached 
 thereto, are collected and washed Several times with more hydrocarbon Solvent, until the hydrocarbon Solvent appears 
 to be colorless, and are dried (e.g., vacuum dried) in a rotary evaporator at about 40 C. to 80 C., preferably at about 60 
 C., for 1 to 3 hours, preferably for about 2 hours. The term “approximately Spherical' or “approximately Spheroidal' 
 means that all points on the Surface of the particle are within 
 the range of radius r to 2r wherein r is the minimum radial 
 distance between the center of the particle and the closest Mar. 2, 2006 
 point thereto on the Surface of the particle. The magnesium halide compound may alternately be crystallized onto the 
 Silica Seeding agent with known Spray drying techniqueS or 
 by gradually evaporating the Solvent in which it was origi 
 nally dissolved. 
 0017 Next, the catalyst support is slowly added to about 
 10 to 50 moles of a transition metal compound for each mole of magnesium in the magnesium-halide compound at about 
 -30 to 50 C., and the temperature of this mixture is raised 
 to about 20 to 80°C., preferably about 30-60° C. An internal electron donor is added and the temperature is raised, generally with stirring, to about 80 to 130 C., preferably 
 100-110° C., and is kept at that level for about 1 to 3 hours, preferably about 2 hours. 
 0018. The internal electron donor compound, in general, 
 is used in an amount from about 0.05 to about 2.0 moles, 
 preferably about 0.1 to about 0.5 mole, for each mole of magnesium in the magnesium-halide compound. 
 0019. The result is a mixture comprising solid catalyst 
 particles and unreacted transition metal compound and inter 
 nal electron donor compound. 
 0020. The solid catalyst particles are filtered out and, 
 preferably, extracted for about 1 to 3 hours, preferably about 
 2 hours, at about 110 to 140 C., more preferably about 125 C. with a mixture of transition metal compound (about 5 to 30 wt %, preferably about 10 wt %), and an inert solvent, Such as a C-C alkylbenzene, preferably ethylbenzene 
 (about 70 to 85 wt %, preferably about 90 wt %) in a known “Soxhlet” extraction type arrangement. This extraction treat ment enhances catalyst activity and Stereospecificity. Alter 
 natively, the Solid catalyst may receive any number of other 
 known extraction treatments, which may, but need not, include a transition metal treatment. Alternatively, the cata lyst could simply be boiled in a Solution comprising a 
 transition metal compound with or without an inert Solvent, 
 i.e., a Solvent which will not react with the transition metal 
 compound. U.S. Pat. No. 4,745,164 to Schweier et al. and 
 U.S. Pat. No. 6,034,023 to Kersting et al., which are incor porated by reference herein, teach examples of extraction 
 methods which may be utilized in the present invention. 
 0021. The Solid catalyst may be recovered by filtration, 
 washed with an inert Solvent, Such as heptane, hexane, cyclohexane or other aliphatic or cycloaliphatic hydrocar 
 bon, dried by draining off transition metal compound and 
 Solvent, washed a Second time with the inert Solvent, and 
 dried. 
 0022. The solid catalyst Support particles and/or catalyst 
 particles preferably comprise about 0.01 wt % to about 10 wt 
 % silica, more preferably about 0.1 wt % to about 5 wt % 
 Silica. 
 0023 The solid catalyst Support particles and/or catalyst particles preferably have a weight percent ratio of Silica to 
 magnesium-halide compound in the range of about 1:20 to 
 1:3, preferably from about 1:10 to 1:4. 
 0024. The catalyst may preferably be treated with an organo-aluminum co-catalyst and an external electron donor or other Stereoregulating agent to form a Ziegler-Natta 
 catalyst, which may be used, for example, in polymerization 
 reactions. Examples of external electron donor compounds

 0049 Polymerization is initiated by formation of a metal 
 carbon bond (Ti-C). The function of the aluminum alkyl is to alkylate the TiCl. This can be accomplished in a variety 
 of ways: by addition of aluminum alkyl to the reactor Separate from the catalyst, by premixing the aluminum alkyl 
 with the catalyst prior to addition to the reactor, or by 
 premixing of the aluminum alkyl and external electron donor prior to mixing with the catalyst.

 lysts include aluminum trialkyls (AIR) and derivatives thereof wherein an alkyl group is Substituted by an alkoxy

 groups each have 1 to 8 C-atoms, Such as trimethylalumi num, triethylaluminum, tri-isobutylaluminum, trioctylalu 
 minum or methyldiethyl aluminum. 
 0051. The equipment used in the processes of the inven

 substituted for by those familiar with catalysts and their production. Reactor Systems can include high pressure, 
 Stainless Steel vessels, low preSSure, glass vessels, CSTR 
 vessels, loop reactors, Vertical Stirred-bed gas phase reac 
 tors, horizontal Stirred-bed gas phase reactors, Vertical, 
 fluid-bed gas phase reactors, and the like. 
 0052 The catalysts of the present invention were tested for polymerization performance using a 2-liter, jacketed, 
 stainless steel reactor available from Pressure Products 
 Industries, Inc., 900 Louis Drive, Warminster, Pa. 18974. Liquid propylene was metered in using a high preSSure Site-glass. Hydrogen was added by measuring the preSSure 
 differential across a 300 ml vessel. 
 0053 A test sample of a preferred catalyst of the inven 
 tion was prepared and tested as follows: 
 Catalyst Preparation Procedure 
 0054) 50 milligrams of CAB-O-SIL(R) was dispersed in 
 about 250 ml of mineral oil in a flask by stirring. Subse quently, 10 grams of anhydrous MgCl, followed by 6 equivalents of anhydrous ethanol (per equivalent of magne 
 sium) was added. The mixture was heated until the ethanol began to reflux. The mixture was maintained at this tem perature for about 1 hour with continuous Stirring. 
 0055. The contents of the flask were then rapidly trans ferred to a Second flask containing 1 liter of heptane pre chilled to dry icefisopropanol temperatures. After an hour 
 the temperature of the contents of the Second flask were 
 allowed to warm to room temperature and were then filtered. Approximately Spherical Solid catalyst Support particles 
 were collected and washed Several times with heptane, until the Washings appeared to be colorleSS, and then Vacuum dried in a rotary evaporator at 60° C. for about 2 hours.  US 2006/0046928A1 
 0056 Next, the solid catalyst Support particles were 
 added slowly to a third flask containing 200 ml of neat TiCl, 
 which had been pre-cooled to about 0° C. After the tem perature was raised to about 50-60 C., 1.5 ml of di-n- butylphthalate, a di-alkylcarboxylic acid ester, as an internal 
 electron donor, was added. The contents of the third flask were heated to 100-110° C. and held at that temperature for 
 about 2 hours. 
 0057 The heat was removed, and solid catalyst particles 
 and liquid from the third flask were transferred to a Soxlet extractor. The liquid, which comprised unreacted TiCl, and 
 internal electron donor compound, was removed by filtering through a porous Sintered glass filter that is part of the 
 reaction vessel. The remaining Solid catalyst particles were 
 then extracted for about two hours at 125 C. with a mixture 
 of 90% ethylbenzene and 10% TiCl. This TiCl, treatment greatly enhances the performance of the catalyst. 
 0.058 At the conclusion of the extraction, the Solid cata lyst particles were dried by draining off residual TiCland ethylbenzene, Washing with heptane, and vacuum drying. 
 The polymerization productivity of the catalyst was then 
 tested using the general polymerization procedure described 
 below. 
 Polymerization Testing Procedure 
 0059) A quantity of 4 ml of 25 wt % triethylaluminum 
 (TEAl) was added to a leg of a two-leg stainless Steel injector, along with 2 ml of a 0.1 molar Solution of cyclo hexylmethyl dimethoxysilane, as an external electron donor. 
 The aluminum alkyl activates the catalyst by replacing one 
 of the chlorides on the titanium with an alkyl group. There after, alkylation can propagate continued insertion of pro pylene groups during a polymerization reaction. The exter 
 nal electron donor is important for controlling the nature of the propylene insertion, but it is not necessary for Starting or maintaining propylene insertion. 
 0060 20 Milligrams of a mixture containing 2 parts anhydrous MgCl2 and 1 part of the experimental catalyst 
 prepared above was added to another leg of the injector. The experimental catalyst was diluted in this manner to facilitate 
 more accurate measurement of Small quantities of catalyst 
 tested in this example. The injector was then attached to the 
 reactor So that the contents of the injector legs could be charged to the reactor under inert atmospheric conditions. 
 0061 A polymerization reaction vessel comprising a 2-li 
 ter, Stainless Steel, jacketed pressure vessel, was purged of 
 moisture and oxygen by heating to at least 100° C. while a 
 Slow bleed of dry nitrogen was maintained through the 
 vessel. The TEAl and external electron donor were added to 
 the reactor by flushing the appropriate injector leg with 
 600-800 ml of propylene. The catalyst was then added in a 
 similar fashion by flushing the other leg of the injector with 200-400 ml of liquid propylene. 100 delta-psig (as measured 
 across a 300 ml vessel) of hydrogen was added to the reactor. 
 The vessel was sealed and heated to about 70° C. Once the 
 temperature was at about 70° C., the polymerization reaction 
 was allowed to continue for one hour. The polymerization reaction was then Stopped by venting the residual propylene. 
 The polymerization reaction vessel was opened and polymer 
 was removed. 
 0.062 Catalyst productivity was measured by dividing the grams of polymer produced by the milligrams of active 
 catalyst initially charged to the reactor. Mar. 2, 2006 
 0063. The catalysts of the invention may be advanta geously used in the polymerization of alk-1-enes. Suitable 
 alk-1-enes include linear or branches C-Co alkenes, in particular linear C-C alk-1-enes Such as ethylene, propy 
 lene, but-1-ene, pent-1-ene, hex-1-ene, hept-1-ene, Oct-1- 
 ene non-1-ene, dec-1-ene or 4-methylpent-1-ene. Mixtures 
 of these alk-1-enes may be polymerized as well. 
 0064. The catalysts of the invention are, in particular, excellent catalytic Systems for use in the production of propylene polymers, both homopolymers of propylene as 
 well as copolymers of propylene and one or more further 
 alk-1-enes having up to 10 carbon atoms. 
 0065. The term copolymers as used herein also refers to copolymers wherein the further alk-1-ene having up to 10 carbon atoms is incorporated randomly. In these copolymers 
 the comonomer content is generally less than about 15% by weight. The copolymerS may also be in the form of So-called block or impact copolymers, which comprise at least a 
 matrix of a propylene homopolymer or propylene random 
 copolymer containing less than 15% by weight of a further 
 alk-1-ene having up to 10 carbon atoms and a Soft phase of a propylene copolymer containing about 15% to about 80% 
 by weight of further alk-1-enes having up to 10 C-atoms. 
 Also mixtures of comonomers are contemplated, resulting in, e.g., terpolymers of propylene. 
 0066. The production of the propylene polymers may be 
 carried out in any common reactor Suitable for the polymer 
 ization of alk-1-enes, either batchwise or, preferably, con tinuously, i.e., in Solution (bulk phase), as Suspension poly merization or as gas phase polymerization. Examples of 
 Suitable reactors include continuously operated Stirred reac 
 tors, loop reactors, fluid bed reactors, or horizontal or 
 vertical stirred powder bed reactors. It will be understood that the polymerization may be carried out in a Series of consecutively coupled reactors. The reaction time depends 
 on the chosen reaction conditions. In general the reaction time is from about 0.2 hours to about 10 hours, usually from 
 about 0.5 hours to 5.0 hours. 
 0067. In general the polymerization is carried out at a 
 temperature in the range of from about 20° C. to about 150 C., preferably from about 50° C. to about 120° C., and more preferably from about 60° C. to about 90° C., and a pressure 
 in the range of from about 1 bar to about 100 bar, preferably 
 from about 15 bar to about 40 bar, and more preferably from 
 about 20 bar to 35 bar. 
 0068 The molecular weight of the so produced polymers 
 may be controlled and adjusted over a wide range by adding 
 polymer chain transfer or termination inducing agents as commonly used in the art of polymerization, Such as hydro 
 gen. In addition an inert Solvent, Such as toluene or hexane, or an inert gas, Such as nitrogen or argon, and Smaller amounts of a powdered polymer, e.g., polypropylene pow 
 der, may be added. 
 0069. The weight, i.e., (average molecular weights) of the propylene polymers produced by using the catalytic System 
 of the invention, in general, are in the range of from about 10,000 g/mole to 1,000,000 g/mole and the melt flow rates 
 are in the range of from about 0.1 to about 100 g/10 min, 
 preferably from about 0.5 to about 50 g/10 min. The melt flow rate corresponds to the amount which is pressed within 
 10 minutes from a test instrument in accordance with ISO ","ParsedChatCompletion[PatentInfo](id='chatcmpl-BEIrZKoKtnuFO8vswYYPTz5kzx0SX', choices=[ParsedChoice[PatentInfo](finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ParsedChatCompletionMessage[PatentInfo](content='{""experiments"":[{""id"":""Example 1"",""text_of_example"":""Catalyst Preparation Procedure  0054) 50 milligrams of CAB-O-SIL(R) was dispersed in about 250 ml of mineral oil in a flask by stirring.

 Pilot Plant Tests 
 0218. A pilot plant continuously operated was used to 
 prepare LLDPE as shown in FIG. 2. 
 0219. A fluidized bed gas phase reactor 1 with 45 cm of 
 internal diameter and 120 cm of reaction Zone height is fed by a dry-solid catalyst feeder 2. The bed of polymer particles 
 in reaction Zone 3 is kept in fluidized state by a recycle 
 stream 4 that works as a fluidizing medium as well as a dissipating heat agent for absorbing the exothermal heat 
 generated within reaction Zone 3. The superficial velocity of 
 the gas, resulting from the flow rate of recycle stream 4 
 within reactor 1 is 0.7 m/s. Stream 5, which contains the gas discharged from reactor 1, said gas having low monomer 
 contents, is fed to the Suction of compressor 6. The com 
 bined reaction and compression heats are then removed from recycle stream 5 in an external heat exchange system 7 in 
 order to control the reactor temperature. The composition of stream 5 is kept constant to yield a polymer with the required specifications. 
 0220 Make-up components are fed to the system at spot 
 8 So as to make up the composition of recycle stream 5. So, 
 make-up stream 8 will include the triethyl aluminum 
 (TEAL) that directly reacts in a ratio of 2 moles of TEAL per mole of catalyst. Also at the spot 8, propane is fed as the 
 selected non-reactive compound required to maintain the total pressure of the system.  US 2006/0166812 A1

 0221) The polymerization catalyst is introduced as a dry 
 powder by a catalyst feeder into reactor 1 in a site within the 
 reaction Zone 3, close to the distributing plate 9 in a rate to 
 control the residence time of the catalyst. The reactive gases, 
 including ethylene and comonomers are introduced at the spot 10. 
 0222. The produced polymer is discharged from the reaction Zone through a discharge system 11 that provides 
 the recovery of the reactive and non-reactive gases, recy 
 cling said gases back to the recycle stream 5 at spot 12 and lowers the pressure of the discharged mixture of polymer 
 and gases at certain pressure for later conveying the pro duced polymer particles 13 for downward sampling.

 ous phase in a fluidized bed. The use of oxide carriers having a particle size of more than 30 Jum, which may be obtained for example by separating fine particles by sieving, prevents finely divided catalysts or polymer 
 parts from being carried out of the fluidized bed and forming deposits in exterior zones of the reactor. The catalyst according to the invention permits prep aration of a polymer, the powder in bulk of which has a high air permeability and thus may directly be used in the processing by injection molding or extrusion with out previous granulation. A good air permeability of the powder in bulk in the extruder feeding zone prevents an incorporation of air into the molten polymer, which 
 would cause a formation of bubbles in the finished part. The porous silicon dioxide having one or more sur face OH groups is designated as ""silicic acid' in the examples. For determining the number of hydroxyl groups of 
 the carrier 10.0 g of the dried silicic acid are reacted under an argon atmosphere while refluxing and stirring with a solution of 500 mmols of n-propyl magnesium chloride in 500 ml of diethyl ether, for a period of 4 hours. After settling of the silicic acid magnesium is retitrated in the supernatant solution by way of com plexometry. The titanium content of component A is determined colorimetrically by using hydrogen peroxide (cf. G. O. 
 Muller, Praktikum der quantitativen chemischen Ana lyse, 4th edition, (1957), page 243). For the polymerization in suspension there is used a hydrated Diesel oil fraction having a boiling range of 
 from 140 to 200 C. 
 The melt index of the polymer is determined accord ing to DIN (German Industrial Standard) 53,735, at 190° C., by using a load of 5 kg for is and of 15 kg for i15. The reduced specific viscosity (RSV) is determined with a solution of decahydronaphthalene at 135 C. at a 
 concentration of 1 g/b 1. The bulk density is determined by weighing 100 cm of polyethylene powder. The air permeability is determined in the following manner: 100 cm3 of polyethylene powder are placed in a graduated cylinder, which has an inner diameter of 3 cm and a fritted glass bottom, and air suctioned through the powder at a rate of flow of 4 l/h; the pressure de crease occuring in the powder in bulk is determined. The air permeability is then determined in the following 
 nanner: 
 height of the package X flow velocity air permeability (L) = diameter of the cylinder X pressure loss. 
 In the present invention L is 0.023/A p - 1, whereby A p is millimeters of the water column and 1 mm water column corresponds to the pressure loss of the glass frit. The diamension of L is (cm . . sec/g). All solvents are distilled under an inert gas atmo sphere having a purity of at least 99.995% in a circula tion apparatus while passing over benzophenone potas sium and are withdrawn under an inert gas atmosphere. The preparation of the catalyst and the polymerization of ethylene are carried out under an argon atmosphere or under an atmosphere of purified nitrogen while care fully excluding air and humidity. The following examples illustrate the invention.

 range of from 300-800 psi. The melt index of the polyethylene produced by the 
 invention catalyst can be controlled by methods known to the art such as increasing the temperature of poly merization or by the addition of hydrogen. These cata lysts show relatively high activity in ethylene polymeri zation and copolymerization. The polymers can be eas 
 ily blended with antioxidants and pelletized for com mercial use. High partial pressures of hydrogen can be used to yield very high melt index products. The catalysts are useful for producing polymers of 
 1-olefins of 2 to 8 carbon atoms and copolymers of these 
 with 1-olefins of 2 to 20 carbon atoms to form solid polymers or copolymers. 
 EXAMPLES 
 EXAMPLE 1 
 A catalyst was made with silica treated with hex amethyl disilazane and with the addition of n-butyl alcohol. A control catalyst was made without the addi tion of the alcohol for comparison. Davison Chemical grade 952 silica was treated with hexamethyl disilazane. A 2.6 g quantity of the treated silica was transferred to a dry, nitrogen-filled flask. The silica was stirred with a magnet bar for one hour while a flow of N2 was passed through the flask. Then 7.7 ml of dibutyl magnesium-triethyl aluminum complex 
 (Mg/Al=6.1) solution, 8.9 wt.% in heptane, 0.59 ml n-butyl alcohol, and 16.25 ml of heptane were added sequentially. The combination was kept at room tem perature, under continuous N2 flow, and stirring for 30 
 minutes. Then 0.36 ml titanium tetrachloride was 
 added, and the combination stirred an additional 30 minutes at room temperature. The flask was immersed in a constant temperature bath at 90° C. until the hep tane was evaporated and carried away by the N2 stream. The catalyst remained in the flask as a free-flowing, light-yellow colored powder. The catalysts were tested for ethylene polymerization 
 at 215 F. with 500 ml isobutane in a 1400 ml vessel. 
 Triisobutyl aluminum (TIBAL) solution in an amount of 9.2 mmoles per gram of catalyst was added for each test. The total pressure was 550 psig in each case. The following results were obtained:

 EXAMPLE 2 
 Another catalyst was made as described in Example 1 except that the proportions of magnesium compound, 
 butyl alcohol, and titanium chloride were increased relative to the silane-treated silica. In this example, the amount of titanium tetrachloride was 1.75 mmol per gram of silane-treated silica instead of 1.25 mmol per gram. The Ti/Mg and alcohol to magnesium ratios were kept equal to 1.0. For comparison, a catalyst was made in the same way 
 but without the addition of the n-butyl alcohol. O

 The two catalysts were tested in a 2 1 polymerization vessel. A 1000 ml volume of isobutane was pressured into the vessel as a slurry medium, and hydrogen was added to give a 100 psi pressure increase. During the polymerization tests, ethylene was fed as required to keep the total pressure constant at 550 psig. TIBAL at 9.2 mmoles per gram was the catalyst. The tests showed that the invention catalyst gave a much higher melt

 EXAMPLE 3 
 Another test of the catalyst of Example 2 was done in the 2 l pressure vessel but with only 50 psi hydrogen 
 added instead of 100 psi. This test gave an hourly catalyst reactivity of 5052 
 with the product having a melt index of 2.4 and an RD value of 3.6. Previously, a comparison catalyst had been 
 made in a similar way but without silane-treated silica. in place of the silane-treated Davison 952 silica, ther mally treated silica was used. The temperature of treat ment was 600 C. This comparison catalyst gave an hourly reactivity of 224.5, a melt index of 3.0, and an RD 
 value of 4.5. The RD value is a measure of molecular 
 weight distribution and was measured as described in the article in Polymer Engineering and Science, Vol. II, pages 124-128 (1971). The lower RD value of the poly mer produced by the invention catalyst shows the prod uct to be more suitable for injection molding applica 
 tions. 
 EXAMPLE 4 
 The two catalysts of Example 2 were tested for ethy lene-butene copolymerization in a 1400 ml pressure vessel. In each case a sample of the catalyst, a volume of 25 wt.% triisobutyl aluminum solution and 500 ml of isobutane were introduced into the polymerization wes sel. The amount of trisobutyl aluminum solution was chosen to give 9.2 mmol/g of solid catalyst. The tem perature of polymerization was 160' F. After the isobu tane addition, hydrogen was added to give a 50 psi increase in pressure. Ethylene and 1-butene were then metered in over a period of five to seven minutes. Eth ylene was added as required to give a total pressure of 
 350 psig while the amount of 1-butene added was ap proximately 22 wt.% of the reaction vessel contents. 
 The reactions were continued for one hour after the 350 
 psig total pressure was attained. During this hour an additional 15 g quantity ofbutene was added to replace the portion polymerized.

 EXAMPLE'S 
 A catalyst was made in the same manner as described in Example 1 except that a different magnesium com pound was used. A 1.8g quantity of hexamethyldisila 
 Zane-treated silica was combined in a nitrogen atmo sphere with 20 ml of heptane and 5.7 ml of abutyl octyl magnesium solution in heptane. The quantity of butyl octyl magnesium was 2.25 mmoles. The combination was stirred one half hour at room temperature, then 0.21 ml of n-butyl alcohol was added. This mixture was stirred for one half hour. A 0.25 ml volume of titanium tetrachloride was added as small drops from a syringe to form the catalyst slurry. The slurry was kept at room temperature for another thirty minutes, then the flask 
 was immersed in an oil bath at 100 C. The flask was 
 kept in the bath for 30 minutes at the end of which time the solvents had evaporated leaving a free-flowing 
 solid. 
 Another catalyst was made with the butyl octyl mag nesium solution in the same way except that the n-butyl alcohol was omitted. 
 The two catalysts were tested under identical condi tions as described in Example 2, in a 21 polymerization vessel with 100 psi hydrogen at 215 F. The results show that the alcohol catalyst gave polyethylene of higher melt index.

 EXAMPLE 6 
 This example shows the use of another magnesium compound. A catalyst was prepared with the addition of n-butyl alcohol in the same way as the catalyst of Example 5 except that a dibutyl magnesium solution was added instead of the butyl octyl magnesium solu tion. The dibutyl magnesium solution was obtained from the Lithium Corporation of America. In this prod uct, a portion of butyl groups are secondary butyl groups and the remainder are normal butyl groups. A polymerization test was conducted as in Example 5 giving polyethylene with a melt index of 49 and a reac tivity of 1463 g/g cat. hr. 
 EXAMPLE 7 
 In this example, the molar ratio of the alcohol to the magnesium compound was varied. Three catalysts were made with the addition of n-butyl alcohol as described in Example 5 but with different amounts of alcohol. Also, in this case, butyl ethyl magnesium was used as the magnesium compound. The amount of butyl ethyl magnesium solution for each of the three catalysts was 1.25 mmoles per gram of the hexamethyldisilazane 
 treated silica. The amount of titanium tetrachloride was 
 also 1.25 mmoles per gram in each case. However, the volume of n-butyl alcohol added was varied as shown 10

 EXAMPLE 8 
 This example shows the preparation of a catalyst with aMg/Tiatomic ratio of 0.5 instead of the Mg/Tiatomic ratio of 1.0 in previous examples. The procedure for preparation was the same as in Example 5, and butyl ethyl magnesium was the magnesium compound. A 2.1 
 g quantity of the silane-treated silica was transferred to the dry, N2-purged flask. A 20 ml volume of heptane and 1.91 ml of the butyl ethyl magnesium solution were combined with the silica. With reaction periods as in Example 5, 0.11 ml n-butyl alcohol and 0.29 ml of tita nium tetrachloride were added. The solvent was evapo rated by heating at 100° C. for 50 minutes. In the poly merization test at 215 F. with 100 psi H2, polyethylene with a melt index of 36 was produced. The reactivity of the catalyst was 2471 g/g cat. hr. TIBAL solution at 9.2 mmoles per gram of catalyst was again employed as the cocatalyst. 
 EXAMPLE 9 
 This example shows that the magnesium to titanium atomic ratio can be greater than 1.0 in the invention catalyst. The procedure and ingredients were the same as in Example 8 but the Mg/Tiatomic ratio was 1.5, the butyl ethyl magnesium to n-butyl alcohol molar ratio 
 was 1.0, and the titanium tetrachloride was 1.25 mmoles per gram of silane-treated silica. The catalyst was tested for the synthesis of a 1 butene-ethylene copolymer as described in Example 4. 
 The reactivity was found to be 4364 g/g cat. hr. The melt index of the product was 2.9 and its density was 0.927. 
 The catalyst was also tested in the particle form syn thesis of polyethylene as described in Example 2. The melt index of the homopolymer was 57, and the reactiv ity of the catalyst under the given conditions was 1917 g/g cat. hr. 
 EXAMPLE 10 
 A catalyst was prepared as in Example 1 except that benzyl alcohol was added to the preparation instead of butyl alcohol. The catalyst was tested in ethylene butene copolymerization as described in Example 2. The catalyst reactivity was 1321 g/g cat. per hour, and 
 the melt index was 2.6. 
 EXAMPLE 11 
 A quantity of Davison Chemical Company grade 952 
 silica was first dried at 300 C. in a bed fluidized by nitrogen. A 1.3 g quantity of the dried silica was trans ferred to a flask, and combined with 15 ml hexane and 0.24 ml of allyldimethylchlorosilane. The amount of allyldimethylchlorosilane was 1.25 mmoles per gram of 
 silica. The combination was stirred in an inert atmo 
 sphere at room temperature for 30 minutes. At this  4,374,753 
stage, volatile materials were evaporated in a nitrogen 11 
stream by immersing the flaskin a bath at 100° C. Upon cooling, 15 ml hexane and 3.9 ml of dibutyl magnesium triethylaluminum complex solution (Mg/Al=6.1) were 
 added. After 30 minutes, 0.15 ml of n-butyl alcohol was added. The molar ratio of alcohol to dibutyl magnesium 
 was calculated to be 1.0. After an additional 30 minutes, 
 0.13 ml of titanium tetrachloride was added. The sol 
 vents were evaporated in a nitrogen stream at 100 C. The dry catalyst was white. 
 The catalyst was tested with triisobutyl aluminum cocatalyst in ethylene-butene copolymerization as de 
 scribed in Example 2. The reactivity was 2735 g/g cat. per hour, the melt index was 4.8, and the density was 
 0.919. 
 This example shows that allyldimethyl chlorosilane can be the silane compound. 
 EXAMPLE 12 
 The catalyst of Example 11 was tested in ethylene hexene copolymerization. The procedure was similar to 
 that described in Example 2. Instead of about 22 wt.% 
 butene, about 26 wt.% 1-hexane was added. Also, in stead of a total pressure of 350 psig, the pressure in this test was 300 psig. The product was recovered as particles. Its melt index was 6.5, and its density was 0.924. The catalyst reactivity was 2095 g/g cat. per hour. This example shows that low density ethylene-hexene 
 copolymers can be made with the catalyst of this inven 
 tion. 
 EXAMPLE 13 
 A catalyst was prepared in Example 11 except that an equimolar amount of n-dodecyl trichlorosilane was substituted for the allyldimethylchlorosilane. This catalyst was tested in ethylene-butene copoly merization as described in Example 2. The product 5

 copolymer had a density of 0.919 and a melt index of 40 3.1. The reactivity was 2832 g/g cat. per hour. 
 EXAMPLE 14 
 Again, a catalyst was made as in Example 11, but with a different silane compound. The silane compound was N,O-bis-(trimethylsilyl)acetamide. In an ethylene 
 butene copolymerization test like Example 2, the reac 
 tivity was found to be 2010 g/g cat. per hour. 
 EXAMPLE 15 
 A catalyst was made as in Example 11, but with N trimethylsilyl diethylamine. In ethylene-butene copoly 
 merization, the reactivity was found to be 3351 g/g cat. per hour. 
 EXAMPLE 16 
 In this example the order of addition of the catalyst components is different. Davison Chemical grade 952 silica was treated with hexamethyldisilazane. Prior to catalyst preparation, this treated silica was heated at 100° C. for one hour in flowing nitrogen. To 2.0 g of the treated silica, 20 ml of hexane and 0.23 ml of n-butyl 
 alcohol were added. The combination was stirred for 30 minutes, then 5.94 ml of a dibutyl magnesium triethyl aluminum complex solution was added (Mg/Al=6.1). The concentration was 8.9 wt.%, and the solvent was heptane. After another 30 minutes, 0.28 ml of titanium tetrachloride was added. The liquids were evaporated 45

 at 100 C. under nitrogen starting 30 minutes after the 
 addition of the titanium tetrachloride. 
 The catalyst was tested three times in copolymeriza tions with the following results:

 The temperature of the experiments was 160 F. for butene copolymerization and 155 F. for hexene copoly merization. For butene copolymerizations, the total pressure was 350 psig, and for hexene copolymeriza tion, it was 300 psig, Hydrogen to give a 50 psi increase in pressure was added to the isobutane, which was the 
 solvent in each test. 
 EXAMPLE 17 
 An invention catalyst was made again like Example 
 16 except that the butyl alcohol was added after the magnesium compound instead of before it. This catalyst was tested as described in Example 16.

 This example and Example 16 show that increased

 this invention when the alcohol is added before the 
 magnesium compound and after the magnesium com pound.

 Finally, the fluidized bed reactor is equipped with an adequate venting system to allow venting the bed dur 
 ing start up and shut down. The reactor does not re quire the use of stirring means and/or wall scraping 
 means. The highly active supported catalyst system of this invention appears to yield a fluid bed product having an average particle size between about 0.005 to about 0.07 inches and preferably about 0.02 to about 0.04 inches. The feed stream of gaseous monomer, with or with out inert gaseous diluents, is fed into the reactor at a space time yield of about 2 to 10 pounds/hour/cubic 
 foot of bed volume. 
 The term virgin resin or polymer as used herein means polymer, in granular form, as it is recovered from the polymerization reactor. Certain of the catalysts of the present invention are capable of producing low density. ethylene/hexene 
 copolymers in a gas phase, fluid bed reactor, which copolymers are capable of being formed into films hav ing especially desirable properties. More particularly, these catalysts are prepared by heating silica at a tem perature of at least 600 C., e.g., from about 750° C. to about 850 C., for a period of time sufficient to remove physically and chemically bound water on the silica to the extent that from about 0.3 to about 0.7 mmoles of OH groups are present per gram of silica. This silica is then slurried in a liquid medium and contacted with from about 1.1 to about 2.5 mmoles of a Grignard rea gent in this liquid medium for a time and temperature sufficient to permit dissolved organomagnesium to react with reactive OH groups on the silica. The liquid is then evaporated, and the resulting dry, free-flowing powder 
 is slurried in another liquid medium to be contacted with a tetravalent titanium compound, the number of moles of this tetravalent titanium compound being in excess of the number of moles of magnesium supported on the silica. For example, this molar ratio of tetravalent titanium to supported magnesium may be from about 3 
 to about 6. Films having especially desirable properties may be formed with the above-mentioned ethylene/hexene copolymers by a variety of techniques. For example, 
 desirable blown films as well as slot cast films may be formed. Blown films formed from ethylene/hexene copoly mers having a density from 0.920 to 0.927 g/cc may have especially desirable properties for bag structures. For example, such blown films may be fabricated into trash bag structures which, when loaded to capacity, resist breaking when dropped from a height of, e.g., four feet. A particular example of a blown film formed from an ethylene/hexene copolymer having a density of 
 0.927 and a melt index of 1 (ASTM D-1238, condition E), which is, in turn, formed in a gas phase, fluid bed reactor with a catalyst according to the present inven 
 tion, is a blown film having a thickness of 1 mil, a dart impact strength of at least 122g, an MD Elmendorf tear strength of at least 164 g/mil, a TD Elmendorf tear strength of at least 665 g/mil, a MD tensile strength of at least 6,400 lbs/in2 and a TD tensile strength of at least 5,400 lbs/in2. Slot cast films formed from low density ethylene/- hexene copolymers having a density of from about 0.916 to about 0.92 may have especially desirable prop 10

 erties as pallet stretch wrap. For example, such stretch wrap may hold loads together and onto pallets and resist breaking when subjected to forces encountered in loading operations where loads are moved about, dropped, etc. A particular example of a slot cast film formed from an ethylene/hexene copolymer having a 
 density of about 0.92 and a melt index of 1.7 (ASTM D-1238, condition E), which is, in turn, formed in a gas phase, fluid bed reactor with a catalyst according to the present invention, is a slot cast film having a thickness of 1 mil, an MD tensile strength of at least about 5,000 lbs/in, an ultimate elongation of at least 500 percent and a TD Elmendorf tear strength of at least 600 g/mil. The following Examples give examples of reactants and parameters which may be used in accordance with aspects of the present invention. 
 EXAMPLE 1. 
 All procedures were carried out in glass or quartz equipment under purified nitrogen using predried nitro 
 gen purged solvents. Davison silica gel, Grade 952, was dehydrated by fluidizing with nitrogen, heating at 200 C. for two hours and cooling to room temperature. This heated 
 silica is believed to contain about 3 mmoles of OH groups per gram of silica. 
 15g of this product was slurried in 200 ml n-hexane. A 2.0 molar solution of ethylmagnesium chloride in tetrahydrofuran (50 ml, 100 mmoles) was added drop wise to the refluxing slurry over approximately 20 min utes, after which time refluxing was continued for a further 30 minutes. The solvents were distilled off, giv ing 29.5g of dry free-flowing powder. 
 15g of this product (50.8 mmoles of Mg) was slurried in a 0.57 Molar solution of TiCl4 in heptane (150ml, 85.5 mmoles) and refluxed for 45 minutes, filtered, the solids washed with three 150 ml portions of hexane and dried under vacuum. The titanium content of this solid cata 
 lyst was 1.39 mmoles/g. 
 Slurry Polymerizations in n-Hexane 
 1. Ethylene, 1-Butene Copolymerization 
 To 1.0 liter of pure dry n-hexane at 30° C. was added a 1.52 M solution of triethylaluminum (1.90 ml, 2.89 mmoles), 1-butene (50 g, 0.89 moles), hydrogen (0.06 moles) and the above catalyst (0.079 g, 0.11 mmoles Ti) giving an Al/Ti ratio of 26. Ethylene addition was begun and polymerization conditions were adjusted to 80' C. and 120 psig total pressure. After 30 minutes, under these conditions, ethylene addition was stopped and the reactor cooled. Upon vacuum drying, a total of 195g of polymer with a melt index (MI, I2) of 53 and a density of 0.9166 g/cc was obtained. 
 2. Ethylene, 1-Hexene Copolymerization 
 The copolymerization was carried out as in 1 using 
 2.4 ml (3.65 mmoles) of TEAL, 91 g 1-hexene (1.08 moles), hydrogen (0.033 moles) and 0.079 g (0.11 mmoles Ti), giving an Al/Tiratio of 33. After drying, a . total of 150 g of polymer with a MI of 3.95 and a density 
 of 0.9187 g/cc was obtained. 
 COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE A 
 Several catalysts prepared substantially in accor 
 dance with the teachings of the Karoletal U.S. Pat. No. 4,302,566, were used in comparative testing as discussed in Examples given hereinafter. These catalysts prepared  4,481,301 19 
 substantially in accordance with this Karol et al patent are referred to herein as ""comparative A' catalysts or simply as 'A' catalysts. The comparative A catalysts are felt to be substan tially equivalent to the catalysts prepared according to 5 
 the Examples of the Karol et al patent. More particu larly, these catalysts are felt to be substantially equiva lent to those prepared by the following representative procedure. 
 In a 5 liter flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, 10 16.0 g (0.168 Mol) of anhydrous MgCl2 is mixed with 850 ml of pure tetrahydrofuran under nitrogen. The mixture is stirred at room temperature (~25 C.) while 13.05 g (0.069 Mol) of TiCl4 is added dropwise. After complete addition, the contents of the flask are heated 15 to reflux for about one-half to one hour to dissolve the 
 solids. The system is cooled to room temperature and 3 liters of pure n-hexane are slowly added over a period of one-half hour. A yellow solid precipitates. The super 
 natant is decanted and the solids are washed with 3X 20 
 one liter of n-hexane. The solids are filtered and dried in a rotating evaporating flask at 40°-60° C. to give 55g of solid precursor composition. The precursor composition may be analyzed at this 20 
 nitrogen line, and overhead stirrer. Under a slow nitro gen purge, 200 ml of dry hexane was added to the silica while stirring. The silica/hexane slurry was brought to reflux temperature and 50 ml of 2.0 M EtMgCL/THF 
 solution was added dropwise (about 15 minutes) and the 
 reflux was continued for an additional 30 minutes. After 
 this time, the solvents were removed by distillation and the silica dried at 80 C. under a nitrogen purge. Total yield, 29 grams; Mg (Theory) 3.45 mmols/gm. 
 Step B: 15 grams of Step A reaction product (51.7 mmols of Mg) were placed into a 500 ml reaction flask (apparatus as described above). 200 ml of n-heptane containing 10.0 
 ml (91 mmols) of TiCl4 was added to the flask while stirring. The slurry was refluxed for 45 minutes. After this time, the slurry was cooled to room temperature, transferred to a filter flask (under nitrogen), filtered, washed with four 100 ml portions of hexane and dried under nitrogen purge; Mg (found) 1.65 mmols/gm, Mg (Theory) 1.67; Ti (found) 1.24 mmols/gm. In addition, for comparison reasons, Example 5 was repeated with the molar ratio of TiCl4 added in Step B to the magnesium present on the silica being less than 1. The resultant catalyst and the processing details are point for Mg and Ti content since some of the Mgand- 25 indicated in Table I as Example 5 (Comparative).

Analysis of the solid would typically show the fol- 50 lowing percent by weight: Mg: 6.1 percent, Ti: 4.9 per cent; which corresponds to TiMg2.45Cl39(THF)70. - THF means tetrahydrofuran. . This precursor composition, which constitutes the catalytic portion of the comparative A catalyst, is sup- 55 
 ported on an inert silica carrier and activated in accor dance with the teachings of the Karol et al patent. 
 EXAMPLES 2-7 
 The catalysts of Examples 2-7 were prepared in two 60 steps and the details are summarized in Table I, herein below. The preparation of the catalyst of Example 2 is felt to be representative of the preparation of the cata lysts of Examples 3–7 and is described below: Step A: 65 
 15 grams of Davison silica gel (dried at 200° C. for 4 hours) were placed into a 500 ml 4-neck reaction flask fitted with a dropping funnel, water condensor, dry hexane and about 100 ml of 1-hexene (62.5gms) were added to the autoclave while at ambient temperature. 0.047 gms of catalyst (0.06 mmols of Ti) was slurried into about 50 ml of hexane to which was added suffi 
 cient triethyl aluminum to give an Al/Tiratio of 40. This catalyst slurry was transferred to the reactor using slight nitrogen pressure and 0.03 moles of hydrogen were added by measuring through a calibrated Hoke 
 bomb. The stirring rate was adjusted to 1000 rpm and the temperature control unit set to 80° C. Ethylene pressure 
 was introduced when the autoclave reached 40 C., and the total reactor pressure was adjusted to 115 psi. Polymerizations were continued for 25-35 minutes in order to produce 130-150 grams of polymer. About 400 ppm of Irganox 1076 was added to the polymer/hexane slurry and the hexane was allowed to evaporate under a hood. The products were placed into a vacuum oven overnight at approximately 60' C. to 
 remove residual hexane and monomer. FIG. 2 shows the change in the copolymerization properties of the catalysts of Examples 2-4, as well as comparative A, as measured by resin density at the 1-3  4,481,301 21 I2 melt index level over a range of magnesium loadings into Davison 952 silica dried at 200 C. 
 If silica dried at 800 C, is used in place of silica dried at 200 C., the copolymerization properties of the cata lysts may vary. It is noted that silica dried at 200 C. contains about 6 SiOH groups/100 Angstrom? while silica dried at 800° C. contains only about 1 SiOH group/100 Angstrom. Ethylene/1-butene copolymers were prepared under similar conditions with both comparative A catalyst and the Example 2 catalyst. Table II summarizes the poly merization conditions and product properties of C2/C4 copolymers prepared with A and Example 2 catalysts. 
 Examination of the data in Table II indicates that under similar polymerization conditions the Example 2 cata lyst produced a lower density product than the A cata lyst.

 Examination of FIG. 4 clearly shows that the copoly merization properties of these three catalysts are Exam ple 3 > Example 2 > A. At a 1-hexene to ethylene ratio of about 1.3, the Example 2, Example 3 and A catalysts produced resins with densities of about 0.918 gm/cc, 0.927 gms/cc and 0.935 gms/cc, respectively. The Example 3. catalyst requires about 50 percent 
 (-10 percent) less 1-hexene in the reactor than A cata lyst to produce a LLDPE material with a density of about 0.920 gm/cc. Catalysts were utilized in a two gallon slurry labora tory reactor so that sufficient quantities of polymer 
 (500-800 gms) could be prepared for evaluation. Table IV and FIG. 5 summarize the polymerization condi tions and product properties of ethylene/1-hexene co polymers prepared with catalysts of Examples 3, 5, 6, 7 
 and A. Examination of FIG. 5 suggests that the relative copolymerization properties of these catalysts are (Ex ample 3, Example 5)&Example 6) Example 7d A.

 SO 
 However, at higher hydrogen levels, the Example 2 catalyst products produces a much higher melt index product than A (compare experiments 4 and 3 in Table 
 II). FIG. 3 illustrates the copolymerization differences between the A and Example 2 catalysts. FIG. 3 shows the density versus the butene/ethylene ratio for each of these catalysts. 
 Examination of FIG. 3 suggests that a 0.918 gm/cc LLDPE product requires a C4/C2 ratio of about 2.7 for A catalyst while the Example 2 catalyst requires only a ratio of 1.7. This corresponds to 35 percent less butene in the reactor for the Example 2 catalyst. Table III and FIG. 4 summarize the polymerization conditions and product properties of the ethylene/1- hexene copolymers prepared with A, Example 2 and 3 catalysts in a 1.6 liter slurry reactor. The Example 3 catalyst contains less magnesium and exhibits better 55

This extra heat could result in se vere temperature gradients within certain fluid bed reactors and poor operability and/or bulk density. Therefore, even in gas phase, fluidized bed arrange ments which cannot optimally accommodate relatively high heat generating catalysts, such as the Example 2 catalyst, such fluidizing bed arrangements may readily accommodate relatively low heat generating catalysts, such as the Example 6 catalyst, without encountering problems of severe temperature gradients, poor opera 
 bility and/or poor bulk density.

 The performance of scaled up version of the catalyst of Example 6 (essentially the same as the aforemen tioned version except that the Mg loading in step A is 0.53 mmoles of mg instead of 0.38 mmoles/gl and A catalysts were compared under nearly identical operat 
 ing conditions in a fluidized-bed, pilot reactor. This comparison was accomplished keeping two important operating variables constant, namely temperature, and the molar ratio of hexene to ethylene in the gas phase, and then observing the phYsical properties of the resin product under these comparable conditions. The experiments were done in a pilot-scale fluidized bed reactor which is 18 inches in diameter and capable of producing up to 50 lb/hr of resin. The catalysts used for the comparison were A and the catalyst of Example 6 which was prepared at a pilot plant. The only differ ence between the pilot plant preparation of the catalyst of Example 6 and the laboratory procedure (described 
 earlier) was that a solvent decantation followed by several solvent washes was substituted for the filtration in Step B. Details of the comparison are found in Table VI, and support the slurry reactor findings that the catalyst of Example 6 has significantly improved copo lymerization properties compared to A when run under 
 similar reactor conditions.

 The hexene copolymer samples were extruded into 
 film at standard conditions on a Brabender blown film line. The system comprises a inch extruder feeding a one inch diameter blown film die. The die gap was 0.39 inches. Extrusion rate for all samples was 2.4 lb/hr, at a melt temperature of 185 to 195 C. The film was ex truded at a thickness of 1.5 mils, with a 2:1 blowup ratio and a 2: inch frost line height. All resin samples were stabilized with the same formulation; 700 ppm Kema mine AS 990 to neutralize catalyst residues, 200 ppm Irganox 1010 hindered phenolic antioxidant, and 200 ppm Weston 399 phosphite type peroxide decomposer. Physical properties were then run on the film in the product development laboratory. The values obtained in the laboratory are not in strict accordance with ASTM testing procedures, since the laboratory temper 
 ature and relative humidity are not controlled. The values reported are of merit in an approximate relative sense. Table VII lists the film properties measured on the A and Example 6 catalyzed samples prepared in the fluid bed pilot plant. MD tear strength is a measure of the resistance of the film to the propagation of a tear 
 initiated in the machine direction of the film. TD tear 
 measures the resistance of the film to the propagation of a tear initiated in the transverse direction of the film. Impact strength measures the amount of energy ab sorbed during a high speed puncture of the film. These tests are felt to be of significant value in the ranking of relative toughness.

 The improvement in properties of the Example 6 catalyzed hexene copolymers is due essentially to the improved comonomer incorporation, which results in a significantly lower density at the same reactor condi 
 tions. It can easily be seen from the data in Table VII that the Example 6 catalyzed samples (produced at reactor 
 conditions which bracket those of the A catalyzed sam plesl are much tougher in these tests than the A cata lyzed samples. Impact strength of the Example 6 cata lyzed samples is nearly double that of the A catalyzed samples. TD tear strength is more than 2.5 times that of the A samples, and MD tear strength averages more 
 than 3 times that of the A samples. The melt indices of these samples were all similar, between 1.3 and 1.7. Head pressure readings indicate that the processability of the A and Example 6 resins are essentially the same.  4,481,301 25 
 COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE B 
 The catalyst of this Comparative Example was pre pared in accordance with Example 7 of the Yamaguchi 
 et al U.S. Pat. No. 3,989,881. One will readily note the similarities between this comparative Example B cata lyst composition and the catalytically active precursor composition described in the Karol et al U.S. Pat. No. 4,302,566, e.g., exemplified in the passage extending 
 from line 65 of column 14 to line 26 of column 15. The particular procedure used to prepare the catalyst of comparative Example B is as follows. 15 g (158 mmol) of anhydrous magnesium chloride, MgCl2, was slurried in 530 ml dry tetrahydrofuran 
 (THF) in a one liter 3-necked round-bottomed flask fitted with a magnetic stirrer. 10 g (52.7 mmol) of TiCl4 were added dropwise while heating. The mixture was refluxed for approximately 
 one hour, by which time all solids had dissolved. After cooling, 275 ml hexane were added dropwise at 5 ml/minute to precipitate the solids. The mother-liquors 
 were decanted and the solid washed with two 200 ml 
 portions of hexane by decantation, and dried. The yel low solid contained 3.08 mmol Mg and 0.95 mmol Ti/g catalyst.

 dried at approximately 80 C. under a nitrogen purge. 
 15g of this product was slurried in 45.5 mmols of TiCl4 dissolved in 200 ml n-heptane, and the slurry refluxed for 45 minutes, using the same apparatus as described 
 above. The mixture was allowed to cool to room tem 
 perature, transferred to a filter flask under N2 and fil 
 tered. The solids were washed with three to four 
 100-150 ml portions of hexane and dried under a nitro gen purge. A free flowing yellow powder was obtained. Analyses for Ti and Mg are given in Table VIII. 
 COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE C 
 A catalyst was prepared in substantially the same 
 manner as described for Examples 8 and 9 except that the silica support was omitted. Further details are given 
 in Table VIII. It is noted that the formation of a small 
 amount of precipitate as evidenced by cloudiness was noticed as Grignard was added to hexane. This observa tion would have been masked if silica were present as a hexane slurry. 
 EXAMPLES 10-11 
 Catalysts prepared in the pilot plant were scaled up directly from laboratory preparations, except that de 
 cantation had to be used to wash the final catalyst rather than filtration, as described above Further preparation details are given in Table VIII.

 tomed flask fitted with a stirrer, thermometer, addition funnel, dry nitrogen line and a distillation head to re move solvent. The flask was placed in an oil bath main tained at a controlled temperature. 250 ml hexane was added to the silica while stirring under a slow nitrogen purge. The silica/hexane slurry was brought to reflux temperature and a 2.0 M solution of ethylmagnesium chloride in THF added dropwise 
 over 5-15 minutes. The reflux was continued for an

The catalyst was activated in a catalyst addition flask by adding an amount of 25 weight percent triethylaluminum in hex ane to a given weight of catalyst suspended in 50 ml of dry hexane. Amounts used are given in Tables IX and X. The mixture was pressured into the reactor using nitrogen and the total reactor pressure adjusted to 20 psig with hydrogen. The reactor was heated at 3 C./minute with a set-point at 80 C. Ethylene was intro duced at 60° C. so as to maintain total operating pres sure at 120 psig, Polymerizations were carried out for approximately one hour, giving 450-950 g of polymer.

 weight of the titanium tetrachloride being used per 10 parts by weight of the solid-phase intermediate obtained from the first stage, and finally (1.3) in a third stage, the solid-phase intermediate obtained in the second stage is extracted with a liquid inert hydrocarbon, in particular an alkane, until the solid contains from 0.01 to 30, preferably from 0.03 to 20, in particular from 0.05 to 10, 7% by weight of free titanium tetrachloride, and the titanium component (1) 
 is obtained in this manner. Regarding the novel process, the following may be stated specifically: Provided that the defining feature is taken into ac count, the polymerization process as such can be car ried out in virtually all relevant conventional techno logical embodiments, for example as a batchwise, cyclic or, in particular, continuous process, either as a suspen sion polymerization processor, in particular, a dryphase polymerization process. The stated technological em bodiments, i.e. the technological variants of the poly merization of a-monoolefins by the Ziegler-Natta method, are well known from the literature and in prac tice and therefore require no further description. For the sake of completeness, it may be stated that, in the novel process, it is also possible to regulate the molecular weights of the polymers by the relevant con ventional measures, for example using regulators such as, in particular, hydrogen. Regarding the composition of the novel catalysts, the following may be stated specifically: (1) The liquid inert hydrocarbon to be used for the preparation of the titanium component may be a hydro 
 carbon of the type usually combined with titanium com ponents for catalyst systems of the Ziegler-Natta type 
 without causing damage to the catalyst system or its titanium component. Examples of suitable hydrocar bons are pentanes, hexanes, heptanes, gasolines and cyclohexane. 
 The finely divided magnesium chloride (I) likewise to be used may be a relevant conventional one. It should be essentially anhydrous, i.e. its water content should not exceed 1% by weight of the total amount of magne 
 sium chloride. 
 The alkanois (II) to be used for the preparation of the titanium component (1) may be conventional ones; they should advantageously have relatively high purities. Examples of suitable alkanols are ethanol, n-propyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, n-butyl alcohol, isobutyl alcohol and tert-butyl alcohol, n-butanol being particu larly suitable. The carrier (III) furthermore to be used generally contains, as a base material, an aluminosilicate or, in particular, silica; it is important that it has the required properties; it has been found that the relevant conven tional commercial carrier materials which meet the stated specification are suitable. Alkylchlorosilanes suit able for the preparation of the carrier are monoalkyltri chlorosilanes, dialkyldichlorosilanes and trialkyl mono chlorosilanes, trialkylmonochlorosilanes being particu larly suitable and trimethylchlorosilane being preferred. 
 The titanium tetrachloride (IV) likewise to be used for the preparation of the titanium component (1) should be one which is conventionally used in Ziegler Natta catalyst systems. 
 Furthermore, the phthalic acid derivative (V) defined above can be a commercial one; it should advanta geously be very pure. It has been found that phthaloyl dichloride is very particularly suitable for the purpose 10 
 15

 according to the invention; however, phthalic anhy dride and the dialkyl phthalates, in particular di-n-butyl 
 phthalate, are also suitable. The alkane to be used for the preparation of the tita nium component (1) in stage (1.3) may likewise be a 
 conventional one; it should advantageously have a rela tively high purity. 
 The preparation of the titanium component (1) is 
 simple and can be carried out by the skilled worker without explanations. Regarding stages (1.1), (1.2) and (1.3), it is merely necessary to state that the isolation of the particular resulting solid is advantageously carried 
 out by filtration under suction, which in stage (1.1) should advantageously be followed by washing with a liquid, inert hydrocarbon until the latter no longer ab 
 sorbs any titanium tetrachloride. It has been found that it may also be advantageous if the solid-phase reaction 
 product obtained in the second substance (1.1.2.a) is isolated before being used in the third substage (1.1.3), for example by evaporation to dryness. 
 (2) Suitable aluminum components (2) of the stated 
 formula are the relevant conventional ones of this for 
 mula; they are sufficiently well known from the litera 
 ture and in practice to require no further discussion. An outstanding member is, for example, triethylaluminum. (3) The silane component (3) which completes the catalyst system is, in particular, a trialkoxy(alkyl)aryl 
 or dialkoxydi(alkyl)arylsilane of the stated formula. Outstanding members are triethoxytolyl-, triethoxy(e- thylphenyl)-, dimethoxyditolyl- and dimethoxydi(ethyl phenyl)silane; other examples are trimethoxytolyl-, trimethoxy(ethylpheny)- and trimethoxyphenylsilane, triethoxyphenylsilane, dimethoxydiphenylsilane, and diethoxyditolyl-, diethoxydi(ethylphenyl)- and diethox ydiphenylsilane. 
 The novel process permits homo- and copolymers, for example of the binary or ternary type, including 
 block copolymers, of propene with minor amounts of 
 other C2-C12-a-monoolefins to be prepared in an ad vantageous manner, particularly suitable a-monoolefins as comonomers be polymerized being ethene, but-1-ene, 4-methylpent-1-ene and hex-1-ene; other suitable exam 
 ples are n-oct-1-ene, n-dec-1-ene. and n-dodec-1-ene.

 by weight of the carrier (III), after which the phthaloyl dichloride (V) is introduced, 27 molar parts of the phthaloyl dichloride (V) being used per 100 molar parts of the magnesium chloride (I), the combined substances are kept at 100° C. for 0.25 hour while stirring, and the resulting solid-phase intermediate is isolated by filtra tion under suction with removal of the liquid phase, 
 then 
 (1.2) in a second stage, the solid-phase intermediate obtained in the first stage is subjected to a two-phase 
 extraction with titanium tetrachloride at 125° C. for 0.5 hour in each stage, in each case 70 parts by weight, i.e. a total of 140 parts by weight, of the titanium tetrachlo ride being used per 10 parts by weight of the solid-phase 
 intermediate obtained from the first stage, after which the resulting solid-phase intermediate is isolated by means of filtration, and finally (1.3) in a third stage, the solid-phase intermediate obtained in the second stage is extracted with n-heptane until the solid contains 3.8% by weight of free titanium tetrachloride, and the titanium component (1) is ob tained in this manner.

 into the solvent, preferably while stirring, and heating the mixture is about 25 to about 100 C., preferably about 40 to about 60° C. The slurry is then contacted with the aforementioned organomagnesium composi 
 tion, while the heating is continued at the aforemen tioned temperature. The organomagnesium composition has the empirical 
 formula Rin Mg R"", where R and R' are the same or different C4-C12 alkyl groups, preferably C4-C10 alkyl groups, more preferably C4-C8 unsubstituted alkyl groups, and most preferably both R and R' are n-butyl groups, and m and n are each 0, 1 or 2, providing that m-n is equal to the valence of Mg. Suitable non-polar solvents are materials in which all of the reactants used herein, i.e., the organomagnesium composition, the compound of formula (II) and the transition metal compounds are at least partially soluble and which are liquid at reaction temperatures. Preferred non-polar solvents are alkanes, such as hexane, n-hep tane, octane, nonane, and decane, although a variety of other materials including cycloalkanes, such as cyclo 
 hexane, aromatics, such as benzene and ethylbenzene can be employed. The most preferred non-polar solvent 
 is hexane. Prior to use, the non-polar solvent should be purified, such as by percolation through silica gel and 
 /or molecular sieves, to remove traces of water, oxy gen, polar compounds, and other materials capable of adversely affecting catalyst activity. 
 In the most preferred embodiment of the synthesis of this catalyst it is important to add only such an amount of the organomagnesium composition that will be deposited-physically or chemically--onto the support since any excess of the organomagnesium composition 
 in the solution may react with other synthesis chemi cals, and precipitate outside of the support. The carrier drying temperature affects the number of sites on the carrier available for the organomagnesium composi tion-the higher the drying temperature the lower the 
 number of sites. Thus, the exact molar ratio of the or ganomagnesium composition to the hydroxyl groups 
 will vary and must be determined on a case-by-case basis to assure that only so much of the ogranomag nesium composition is added to the solution as will be deposited onto the support without leaving any excess of the organomagnesium composition in the solution. 
 Furthermore, it is believed that the molar amout of the organomagnesium composition deposited onto the sup port is greater than the molar content of the hydroxyl groups on the support. Thus, the molar ratios given below are intended to serve only as an approximate guideline and the exact amount of the organomag nesium composition in this embodiment must be con trolled by the functional limitation discussed above, i.e., it must not be greater than that which can be deposited onto the support. If greater than the amount is added to the solvent, the excess may react with the compound of formula (II), thereby forming a precipitate outside of the support which is detrimental in the synthesis of our catalyst and must be avoided. The amount of the or ganomagnesium composition which is not greater than that deposited onto the support can be determined in any conventional manner, e.g., by adding the or ganomagnesium composition to the slurry of the carrier in the solvent, while stirring the slurry, until the or ganomagnesium composition is detected as a solution in 
 the solvent. 
 For example, for the silica carrier heated at about 200 to about 850 C., the amount of the organomag O

 nesium composition added to the slurry is such that the molar ratio of Mg to the hydroxyl groups (OH) on the 
 solid carrier is about 1:1 to about 6:1, preferably about 2:1 to about 4:1, more preferably about 2.5:1 to about 3.5:1 and most preferably about 3:1, depending upon the 
 temperature at which the carrier material was dried. The organomagnesium composition dissolves in the 
 non-polar solvent to form a solution. 
 It is also possible to add such an amount of the or ganomagnesium composition which is in excess of that 
 which will be deposited onto the support and then re move, e.g., by filtration and washing, any excess of the organomagnesium composition. However, this alterna 
 tive is less desirable than the most preferred embodi 
 ment described above. 
 After the addition of the organomagnesium composi tion to the slurry is completed, the slurry is contacted 
 with at least one compound of the formula (II) 
 R'-OH (II) 
 where R' is a C1-C10 alkyl group or a C1-C10 haloge nated alkyl group, preferably R' is a C1-C10 alkyl 
 group, more preferably a C1-C4 normal alkyl group or a C1-C4 halogenated normal alkyl group, and most preferably R' is an ethyl group. Thus, the compound of 
 formula (II) is preferably an alcohol and most prefera bly ethanol. The amount of the compound of formula (II) used in this synthesis step is sufficient to convert substantially all of the magnesium alkyl (Mg-R or 
 MgR) groups on the carrier to magnesium alkoxy 
 (MgO R') groups. In a preferred embodiment, the 
 amount of the formula (II) compound added is such that substantially no excess thereof is present in the non polar solvent after substantially all of the magnesium alkyl groups are converted to the magnesium alkoxy 
 groups on the carrier to prevent the reaction of the 
 formula (II) compound with the transition metal com pound outside of the carrier. This synthesis step is con ducted at about 25 to about 65° C., preferably at about 30 to about 55 C., and most preferably at about 30 to 
 about 40 C. 
 After the addition of the formula (II) compound is completed, the slurry is contacted with at least one transition metal compound soluble in the non-polar solvent. This synthesis step is conducted at about 25 to about 65° C., preferably at about 30 to about 55 C., and most preferably at about 30 to about 40° C. In a preferred embodiment, the amount of the transition metal compound added is not greater than that which 
 can be deposited onto the carrier. The exact molar ratio 
 of Mg to the transition metal and of the transition metal to the hydroxyl groups of the carrier will therefore vary (depending, e.g., on the carrier drying temperature) and 
 must be determined on a case-by-case basis. For exam 
 ple, for the silica carrier heated at about 200 to 850 C., the amount of the transition metal compound is such that the molar ratio of the transition metal, derived from the transition metal compound, to the hydroxyl groups of the carrier is about 1 to about 2.0, preferably about 1.5 to about 2.0 and the molar ratio of Mg to the transi tion metal is about 1 to about 3, preferably about 2 to about 3. We found that these molar ratios produce a catalyst composition which produces resins having 
 relatively low melt flow ratio (MFR) values of about 20 
 to about 35. As is known to those skilled in the art, such resins can be utilized to produce high strength films and  4,849,389 9 
 known to those skilled in the art, such MFR values are indicative of a relatively narrow molecular weight dis tribution of the polymer. As is also known to those skilled in the art, such MFR values are indicative of the polymers especially suitable for injection molding appli 
 cations since the polymers having such MFR values exhibit relatively low amounts of warpage and shrink age on cooling of the injection molded products. The relatively low MFR values of the polymers prepared 
 with the catalysts of this invention also indicate that they are suitable for the preparation of various film products since such films are likely to have excellent strength properties. MFR is defined herein as the ratio of the high load melt index (HLMI or I21) divided by the melt index, i.e.g., 
 I2 MFR as -- 
 The catalysts prepared according to the present in 
 vention are highly active and may have an activity of at least about 1-14 kilograms of polymer per gram of cata lyst per 100 psi of ethylene in about 1 hour. The linear polyethylene polymers prepared in accor 
 dance with the present invention are homopolymers of ethylene or copolymers of ethylene with one or more C3-C10 alpha-olefins. Thus, copolymers having two 
 monomeric units are possible as well as terpolymers having three monomeric units. Particular examples of such polymers include ethylene/1-butene copolymers, ethylene/1-hexene copolymers, ethylene/1-octene co polymers, ethylene/4-methyl-1-pentene copolymers, ethylene/1-butene/1-hexane terpolymers, ethylene/- propylene/1-hexane terpolymers and ethylene/- propylene/1-butene terpolymers. When propylene is 
 employed as a comonomer, the resulting linear low density polyethylene polymer preferably has at least 
 one other alpha-olefin comonomer having at least four carbon atoms in an amount of at least 1 percent by weight of the polymer. Accordingly, ethylene/propy lene copolymers are possible, but not preferred. The 
 most preferred comonomer is 1-hexene. 10

 herein by reference. The polymer produced in such a reactor contains the catalyst particles because the cata lyst is not separated from the polymer. The following examples further illustrate the essential 
 features of the invention. However, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the specific reactants and reaction conditions used in the Examples do not limit the scope of the invention. 
 EXAMPLE 1. 
 (Catalyst Synthesis) 
 20.0 grams of Davison grade 955 silica which had 
 been heated to 600 C. for about 16 hours under a dry nitrogen purge was slurried in about 200 (milliters) mls 
 of dry hexane contained in a 4-neck 500 ml round bot tom flask kept under a continuous nitrogen purge and 
 fitted with an overhead stirrer and a reflux condenser. 
 The slurry was heated to and maintained are reflux, and 52.4 mls of dibutylmagnesium (DBM), 0.77 Molar solu tion in heptane, was added dropwise to the slurry (about 
 15 minutes) and the reflux continued for one hour. Next, 
 4.15 mls of absolute ethanol diluted in about 40 mls of 
 dry hexane was added dropwise to the slurry (about 15 
 minutes) and reflux continued for an additional hour. Finally, 2.4 mils of TiCl4 diluted in about 40 mls of dry hexane was added dropwise, the reflux was continued 
 for an additional hour, and solvents were removed by distillation and dried at about 85°-90° C. to yield 21.3 grams of a dry, free-flowing powder. The resulting 
 catalyst precursor contained 1.31 mmols of Mg/gram of the precursor, 0.731 mmols of Ti/gram of the precursor, and 2.82 mmols of Cl/gram of the precursor.

 The linear low density polyethylene polymers pro duced in accordance with the present invention prefera bly contain at least about 80 percent by weight of ethyl

 A particularly desirable method for producing linear low density polyethylene polymers according to the 
 present invention is in a fluid bed reactor. Such a reac tor and means for operating it are described by Levine et al, U.S. Pat. No. 4,011,382, Karol et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,302,566 and by Nowlin et al, U.S. Pat No. 4,481,301, the entire contents of all of which are incorporated 60 
 65 EXAMPLES 8-14 
 (Polymerization Process) 
 The catalyst precursors of Examples 1-7 were com bined with triethylaluminum (TEAL) or with trimeth ylaluminum (TMA) catalyst activators to produce ethylene/1-hexane copolymers. A typical polymeriza 
 tion was carried out as follows with the catalyst of Example 1. At about 50° C., and under a slow nitrogen purge, a 1.6 liter stainless steel autoclave, previously  4,849,389 11 
 heated to about 80° C. under purge of dry nitrogen, was filled with 400 mls of dry hexane, 200 mls of dry 1-hex ane and 3.0 mls of triethylaluminum (25 wt % in hex 
 ane). The reactor was closed, and hydrogen was intro duced to raise the internal pressure to 23 psi. The con tents of the reactor was stirred at 900 rpm and the tem perature was increased to about 70° C. The reactor was filled with ethylene to a total pres sure of about 120 psi and then 0.1637 grams of Example 1 catalyst precursor, slurried in about 25 mols of hexane, was added to the reactor. The reactor temperature was adjusted to 80 C. and the reactor pressure was main tained with ethylene. The polymerization was continued for 50 minutes. 200 grams of polyethylene were obtained. The polymer 
 contained 26.5 mole % 1-hexane and it had the follow 
 ing properties: I2 =0.58; I21 = 16.3; I21/I2 = 28.1; den sity = 0.926 gm/cc. The productivies of the catalyst compositions were 
 determined as a function of the alcohol used in the synthesis of the catalyst precursor and of the catalyst 
 activators. The results are illustrated graphically in 
 FIG.1. As is evident from FIG. 1, trichloroethanol produced the most active catalyst precursor, with the 
 TEAL or TMA activators. However, the trichloroe thanol-based-catalyst system decayed relatively rapidly 
 (half-life of about 40 minutes). The data of FIG. 1 indi cates that the TMA activator produces catalyst compo sitions having 2-3 times greater productivities than the 
 TEAL activator used to activate the same catalyst pre 
 CSOS. 
 EXAMPLE 15 
 (Comparative Catalyst Precursor Synthesis) 
 A comparative catalyst precursor was synthesized according to the teachings of Karol et al, European patent application No. 84103441.6, filed on Mar. 28, 
 1984, Publication No. 0 120 503, published on Oct. 3, 1984. This catalyst precursor is substantially equivalent 
 to that of Karol et al, as disclosed in the aforementioned Published European Patent Application. It is also sub stantially equivalent to the precursors prepared by the following representative procedure. 
 (a) Impregnation of Support with Precursor 
 In a 12 liter flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer were placed 41.8 g (0.439 mol) of anhydrous MgCl2 and 2.5 liters of tetrahydrofuran (THF). To this mixture, 
 29.0 (0.146 mol) of TiCl30.33 AlCl3 were added drop wise over a hour period. The mixture was then heated at 60° C. for another hour in order to completely 
 dissolve the material. 
 Five hundred grams (500 g) of silica were dehydrated by heating at a temperature of 600 C. and slurried in 3 liters of isopentane. The slurry was stirred while 186 ml of a 20 percent by weight solution of triethylaluminum 
 in hexane was added thereto over a hour period. The resulting mixture was then dried under a nitrogen purge at 60° C. over a period of about 4 hours to provide a dry, free-flowing powder containing 5.5 percent by 
 weight of the aluminum alkyl. 
 The treated silica was then added to the solution 
 prepared as above. The resulting slurry was stirred for hour and then dried under a nitrogen purge at 60° C. over a period of about 4 hours to provide a dry, impreg nated, free-flowing powder. (b) Preparation of Partially Activated Precursor (i) The silica-impregnated precursor composition 
 prepared in accordance with step (a) was slurried in 3 10

 liters of anhydrous isopentane and stirred while a 20 percent by weight solution of diethylaluminum chloride 
 in anhydrous hexane was added thereto over a hour period. The diethylaluminum chloride (DEAC) solu 
 tion was employed in an amount sufficient to provide 0.36 mols of this compound per mol of tetrahydrofuran 
 (THF) in the precursor. After addition of the diethylal 
 uminum chloride was completed, stirring was contin ued for an additional to hour while a 20 percent by weight solution of tri-n-hexylaluminum (TNHAL) in 
 anhydrous hexane was added in an amount sufficient to provide 0.25 mols of this compound per mol of tetrahy 
 drofuran in the precursor. The mixture was then dried under a nitrogen purge at a temperature of 56-10 C. over a period of about 4 hours to provide a dry, free flowing powder. This material was stored under dry 
 nitrogen until it was needed. 
 EXAMPLE 16 
 (Preparation of LLDPE Product. With TEAL-Activated Precursor of Example 15(b)) 
 The partially activated comparative catalyst precur 
 sor composition of Example 15(b), with the molar ratios 
 of DEAC/THF = 0.36 and TNHAL/THF=0.25, was 
 used to prepare LLDPE product in a 1.6 liter autoclave 
 reactor. Reaction conditions were similar to those in 
 Example 9. The productivity was about 4,000 grams 
 PE/gr cat/hour. 
 EXAMPLE 7 
 (Preparation of LLDPE Proccuts with TMA-Activated Comparative Precursor of Example 
 15(b)) 
 The partially activated comparative precursor com 
 position of Example 15(b) with the molar ratios of 
 DEAC/THF = 0.36 and TNHAL/THF = 0.25, was used to prepare LLDPE product in a 1.6 liter autoclave reactor. Reaction conditions were substantially equiva lent to those of Example 9, except that a TMA activator was used in place of TEAL. Catalyst productivity was 
 about 4,100 gms PE/gm cat/hour. 
 EXAMPLE 1.8 
 (Effect of Increasing Amounts of Cocatalyst on MFR of Polymers) 
 To determine the effect of increasing the amount of TMA and TEAL cocatalyst on the MFR of the poly mers produced with the resulting catalyst compositions, the performance of a catalyst precursor substantially 
 similar to that of Example 1 was compared to that of the comparative catalyst precursor of Example 15b, both 
 activated with varying amounts of the TMA or TEAL cocatalysts. The polymerizations were conducted in the 
 manner summarized below: 
 400 mls of dry hexane was added to a 1.6 liter auto clave at 56' C. while under a slow nitrogen purge. 200 mils (135 grams) of 1-hexane was added, followed by TEAL or TMA. Various amounts of cocatalyst were added to give the concentration ranges shown in FIGS. 5 and 6. Concentration of co-catalyst is expressed as ppm based on the total weight of hexane and 1-hexene used in the polymerization. The reactor was closed, and 
 hydrogen was added from a calibrated hoke bomb, the contents were stirred at 900 rpm and the temperature was increased to 70° C. Ethylene was added to the autoclave to 120 psi and about 0.03–0.06 grams of the  4,849,389 13 catalyst precursor was injected with ethylene overpres 
 sure. The temperature was maintained at 80 C. and 150-200 grams of copolymer was produced in 50-60 
 minutes. The effect of increasing amounts of the TMA or TEAL activator on the MFR of the polymers is shown graphically in FIGS. 5 and 6. 
 EXAMPLES 19-20 
 Polymerizations were carried out similarly to Exam 5 
 ples 9-14, except that 450 mls of hexane and 150 mls of 10 1-hexene were used. TEAL (3 mls of a 25 wt % solution in hexane) was used as the catalyst activator. 14 
 molecule is inserted 152 times for every 1-hexene mole cule that is inserted into the polymer molecule. 
 Molecular Weight Distribution (MWD) of Polymers 
 The effect of catalyst composition and cocatalysts on 
 the MWD of the copolymers is summarized in FIGS. 2 
 and 3. FIG. 2 shows that the MFR for the ethanol-based catalyst of Example 1 depends on both copolymer com position and cocatalyst type. For example, the MFR 
 increases from about 29 to 31 (TEAL) as the 1-hexene content increases. from 2.4 mole% (density of 0.926 gms/cc) to 4.0 mole % (density of 0.914 gms/cc). Over

 DISCUSSION OF EXAMPLES 
 The reactivity of each catalyst used to copolymerize ethylene with 1-hexene is dependent on the catalyst composition. The 1-hexene response is expressed below as a reactivity ratio, r1, defined by the equation: 
 where f=(CE/CH)copolymer 
 F=(CE/CH)monomer 
 r=kEE/kEH In the above formulae, subscripts E and H designate ethylene and hexene, respectively. Thus, lower values of r indicate improved 1-hexene incorporation proper 
 ties. 
 Table III summarizes the catalyst reactivity ratios 
 with 1-hexene as a function of alcohol used or a transi tion metal compound on the precursor synthesis and 
 activator.

 The data of Table III indicates that the catalysts pre pared with all of the alcohols, except 2,2,2-trichlorore thanol, react relatively poorly with 1-hexene in the presence of TEAL as the activator (r1 = 196) indicating that an ethylene molecule is inserted 196 times into the polymer molecule for every 1-hexene molecule that is inserted during the polymerization reaction. In the pres ence of the TMA activator, the reactivity ratio is signifi cantly lower (r1 = 1529), indicating improved (about 22% better) 1-hexene incorporation properties with the TMA-activated catalyst precursor, i.e., an ethylene 25

 65 the same range, copolymers prepared with TMA as 
 cocatalyst have MFR values from about 27 to 29. The data therefore indicates that, unexpectedly, TMA pro vides polymers with a narrower MWD as indicated by 
 MFR values that are about 1-2 MFR units lower com 
 pared to polymers prepared with TEAL-activated cata lysts. 
 FIG. 3 shows a similar trend for other catalysts (of Examples 1, 2, 6 and 7) prepared with different alcohols with TEAL or TMA as a cocatalyst. However, the copolymer prepared with an alcohol-free catalyst pro 
 vided the broadest MWD, as indicated by MFR values of about 38 to about 42. Copolymers produced with catalysts synthesized with alcohol gave MFR values ranging from about 27 to about 35, depending on alco hol type and cocatalyst. Thus, catalysts based on etha nol and TMA give copolymers with the narrowest 
 MWD. Catalysts based on methanol and 2,2,2-trichloro ethanol produce copolymers with MFR values in the 32-37 range depending on density and cocatalyst. At the same density, these catalysts give products with MFR values about 2-6 units higher than copolymers prepared with the ethanol-based catalysts. 
 Comparison of Titanium and Vanadium Based Catalysts of Examples 6 and 6a 
 Two catalysts based on 2,2,2-trichloroethanol were prepared, one with TiCl4 (Example 6) and one with VOCl3 (Example 6A). The comparison of the effect of the transition metal on the catalyst properties is summa 
 rized in Table III. 
 The data in Tables II and III indicate that the catalyst 
 based on titanium is about 7 times more active and in 
 corporate 1-hexene about 2.5 times more slowly than 
 the vanadium-based catalyst. However, the vanadium based catalyst provides a copolymer with a relatively 
 broad MWD. 
 Effect of Drying Temperature 
 To test the effect, if any, of drying temperature on the catalyst properties, a catalyst was prepared in which the 
 temperature used to remove the solvents was lowered from 90° C. (Example 1) to 55° C. Aside from the differ ent drying temperatures, the catalyst synthesis was car ried out substantially as in Example 1. The results are 
 summarized in FIG. 4.

 the cocatalyst Solution. Optionally, the liquid cocatalyst can be fed directly to the fluidized bed. The partially activated catalyst precursor is preferably injected into the fluidized 
 bed as a Solid or a mineral oil slurry. The cocatalyst completes the activation. The product composition can be 
 varied by changing the molar ratioS of the comonomers introduced into the fluidized bed. The product is continu ously discharged in granular or particulate form from the 
 reactor as the bed level builds up with polymerization. The production rate is controlled by adjusting the catalyst feed 
 rate. 
 The hydrogen:ethylene molar ratio can be adjusted to control average molecular weights. The alpha-olefins (other than ethylene) can be present in a total amount of up to 15 percent by weight of the copolymer and, if used, are pref 
 erably included in the copolymer in a total amount of about 1 to about 10 percent by weight based on the weight of the copolymer. 
 Several Steps can be taken, in addition to temperature control, to prevent agglomeration. The product discharge 
 line between the reactor and the product pot is often plugged up with chunks between intervals of product drops. A continuous purge flow of nitrogen or reactor gas in the line prevents the plugging problem. Also, coating the reactor 
 Surface with a low Surface energy material is shown to be beneficial to slow down the rate of fouling build up. In addition, control of the electrostatic level in the bed prevents Static induced particle agglomeration. Static can be adjusted 
 to a Satisfactory level by controlled use of reaction rate, avoidance of quick change of gas composition, Selective use of Static-neutralizing chemicals and Surface passivation with aluminum alkyls. 
 It is preferred to control the Static in the reactor System during Start-up. If the Static is not controlled, Static induced layers of catalyst rich fines can form on the reactor Surfaces. These fines may, in turn, induce localized hot spots and the formation of chunkS. Reactor Surface passivation with an aluminum alkyl minimizes the formation of fines layers. This passivation is accomplished by first building up the 
 aluminum alkyl concentration in the Start-up bed to about 300 to 1000 ppm based on the weight of the bed, and then fluidizing the bed with purified nitrogen or ethylene for 
 Several hours. At the end of this passivation period, the reactor is purged while maintaining the circulation, the 
 reaction conditions are established, and the reaction is kicked off by feeding catalyst into the system. If static still persists, additional purges or Selective use of Static neutral izing chemicals may become necessary to reduce the level of 
 Static. 
 The residence time of the mixture of reactants including gaseous and liquid reactants, catalyst, and resin in each 
 fluidized bed can be in the range of about 1 to about 12 hours and is preferably in the range of about 2 to about 5 hours. 
 The resin blend can be extruded into film in a conven 
 tional extruder adapted for that purpose. Extruders and processes for extrusion are described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,814,135; 4,857,600; 5,076,988; and 5,153,382. Examples of various extruders, which can be used in forming the film are a single Screw type Such as one modified with a blown film die and air ring and continuous take off equipment, a blown film extruder, and a slot cast extruder. A typical Single Screw type extruder can be described as one having a hopper at its upstream end and a die at its downstream end. The hopper feeds into a barrel, which contains a Screw. The barrel can be smooth, but is preferably grooved. At the 
 downstream end, between the end of the Screw and the die, is a Screen pack and a breaker plate. The Screw portion of the 
 extruder is considered to be divided up into three Sections, the feed Section, the compression Section, and the metering Section, and multiple heating Zones from the rear heating 15

 Zone to the front heating Zone, the multiple Sections and Zones running from upstream to downstream. If it has more 
 than one barrel, the barrels are connected in Series. The length to diameter ratio of each barrel is in the range of about 16:1 to about 30:1. The extrusion can take place at tempera tures in the range of about 160 to about 270 degrees C. and is preferably carried out attemperatures in the range of about 180 to about 240 degrees C. 
 The advantages of the invention are found in the high extrusion speed of the resin blend; the high bubble strength; and the high bubble stability. Thus, the blend can be extruded to thinner gauges at higher extrusion Speeds, par ticularly gauges of 0.5 mill or leSS. 
 In order to maintain a constant production rate, increases in ethylene partial preSSure are accompanied by decreases in the amount of catalyst fed. Consequently, catalyst produc tivity is increased, an additional advantage of the process. 
 Conventional additives, which can be introduced into the blend, are exemplified by antioxidants, ultraViolet absorbers, antistatic agents, pigments, dyes, nucleating agents, fillers, Slip agents, fire retardants, plasticizers, processing aids, 
 lubricants, Stabilizers, Smoke inhibitors, Viscosity control agents, and crosslinking agents, catalysts, and boosters, 
 tackifiers, and anti-blocking agents. Aside from the fillers, the additives can be present in the blend in amounts of about 0.1 to about 10 parts by weight of additive for each 100 parts by weight of polymer blend. Fillers can be added in amounts up to 200 parts by weight and more for each 100 parts by weight of the blend.

 The invention is illustrated by the following examples. 
 EXAMPLES 1 to 6 
 The catalyst precursor used in example 1 is manufactured in two steps. In the first step, 390 gallons of tetrahydrofuran (THF) is added to a solution preparation vessel to which BHT (butylated hydroxytoluene) is added as an inhibitor to prevent peroxide formation. Then, 62.5 pounds of aluminum 
 reduced titanium trichloride TiCl, or one part TiCl to 3 parts AlCl (by weight) and 150 pounds of magnesium 
 chloride (MgCl) are added. The mixture is heated to a temperature of 65 to 75 degrees C., and held for a period of 
 4 hours to dissolve. The Solution is filtered to remove 
 insolubles. Then, 220 pounds of Silica are charged to the 
 vessel. The silica is slurried with the solution and the slurry is pumped to a jacketed holding tank maintained at a temperature of 35 degrees C. 
 The Second Step involves Spray drying the above slurry. This is accomplished by continuously feeding the slurry to a spray dryer. Hot nitrogen is circulated through the drying chamber, and the THF is evaporated leaving the TiCl/Mg Cl/THF/silica complex as a solid powder. The solids are then dropped into a slurry tank pre-loaded with dry mineral 
 oil. The slurry tank is then rolled for several hours to produce the catalyst used in example 1. It is Similar to the 
 catalysts described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,376,062 and 4.293, 
 673. 
 A magnesium/titanium alkoxide precursor, which is a Solid reaction product, is prepared according to illustrative 
 embodiment II from U.S. Pat. No. 5,124,298 carried out on a Scale Sufficient to obtain 300 pounds of granular material. Analysis (average of two runs): 12.3 percent Mg, 7.55 percent Ti, 60.3 percent OEt, 0.93 percent o-cresol (Cl= 11.5 percent by charge balance). 
 The activated precursor used in examples 2, 3, 5, and 6 is prepared as follows:  US 6,248,831 B1 
 11 
 To a 10 gallon Stainless Steel reaction/filter vessel are charged 1,892 grams of magnesium/titanium alkoxide pre 
 cursor powder together with 3.5 kilograms of hexane. Then, a solution of 3.9 kilograms of SiCl, and 713 grams of TiCl in 6.6 kilograms of toluene is charged at Such a rate (15 to 20 minutes) as to keep the reaction temperature between 25 and 30 degrees C. The slurry is then stirred for 30 minutes and filtered through an internal filter plate. The solids are washed by re-slurrying in 15 kilograms of a 50/50 (by weight) mixture of hexane and toluene, and are then isolated by filtration. In like manner, the solids are washed twice with hexane and dried under moving nitrogen. The yield is 2,472 grams of yellow powder. Analysis: 10.7 weight percent Mg, 9.82 weight percent Ti; and 36.2 weight percent Cl. 
 The vessel is recharged with 1,302 grams of the yellow powder and 5 kilograms of hexane. Then, 7.291 grams of 25 weight percent ethylaluminum dichloride in toluene are added at Such a rate (15 minutes) as to keep the temperature between 25 and 30 degrees C. Then, 1,175 grams of 1 Molar BC1 in heptane are added all at once. After stirring for 30 minutes at 25 degrees C., the slurry is filtered. The solids are washed once with 50/50 (by weight) hexane/toluene, then twice with hexane and dried overnight under moving nitro gen as above. The yield is 1068 grams of dark brown powder. Analysis: 10.7 weight percent Mg; 9.62 weight percent Ti; 2.38 weight percent Al; and 56.7 weight percent Cl. A polymerization Sample is prepared by Slurrying 1.0 
 kilogram of the powder in 2.57 kilograms of mineral oil. 
 Example 1 is a comparative example and examples 2, 3, 
 5, and 6 represent high density and medium density embodi ments of the invention. Example 4 compares the examples 
 2 and 3 resins with the example 1 resin. 
 EXAMPLE 1. 
 About 85 pounds of polyethylene having a melt index of 1.0 gram per 10 minutes and a density of 0.920 gram per cubic centimeter made with the example 1 catalyst are charged to a first reactor as a Seedbed. About 120 pounds of polyethylene having a flow index of 0.5 gram per 10 minutes 
 and a density of 0.940 gram per cubic centimeter made with the example 1 catalyst are charged to a Second reactor as a 
 seed bed. Comonomers are ethylene and 1-hexene. Both reactors are then purged with high purity nitrogen at 80 
 degrees C. for Several hours until the moisture content is below 10 ppm. Then, about 1500 cubic centimeters of 5 weight percent triethylaluminum (TEAL) in isopentane is 
 charged to each reactor and circulated for a period of 4 hours. TEAL acts as a moisture Scavenger. The reactors are then given 2 high preSSure purges with nitrogen, and the 
 conditions set forth in Table I are established in each reactor:

 reactor and 130 cubic centimeters per hour of 5 weight percent TEAL in isopentane are fed to the Second reactor to Serve as cocatalyst. Then, the example 1 catalyst feed is 
 initiated at the rate of 7.5 cubic centimeters per hour using a slurry catalyst feeder. The ethylene partial pressure in the 15

 first reactor is manipulated to result in a production rate of 30 pounds per hour of resin. The H2/C2 molar ratio and C6/C2 molar ratio are manipulated in the first reactor to result in a resin with a flow index of 0.25 to 0.50 decigram per minute and a density of 0.927 to 0.930 gram per cubic centimeter. The Split in the resin exiting the Second reactor, i.e., the final product, is 60/40 (weight percent), i.e., 60 percent high molecular weight resin and 40 percent low molecular weight resin. This is accomplished by manipu lating the production rate of resin in the Second reactor, which is, in turn, accomplished by adjusting the ethylene partial pressure. The melt index of the final product is about 800 grams per 10 minutes and the density is about 0.963 per cubic centimeter. At a total production rate of 50 pounds per hour (HMW+LMW), a total of 1100 pounds of resin are produced. The bulk resin properties are set forth in Table II as follows. The bimodal product properties are given in the

 Approximately 1500 pounds of resin are produced in each of examples 1 to 3. 
 EXAMPLE 4. 
 Although the reactor conditions used in the examples are Somewhat different, the gas composition is adjusted So as to make products with Similar bulk properties. The product evaluations of the resins produced in examples 2 and 3, 
 however, result in films, which are Superior to the film produced from the resin of example 1. 
 Samples of the three resins are submitted for Size Exclu sion Chromatography (SEC) analysis. The SEC is per 
 formed with a WatersTM 150° C. analyzer with trichloroben Zene as Solvent at 140 degrees C. With a broad molecular weight distribution Standard and broad molecular weight 
 distribution calibration method. 
 Example 1: Mn=13,848

 Examples 2 and 3: Mn=12,179

 The SECs reveal that the examples 2 and 3 products have 
 a broader molecular weight distribution than the example 1 
 product. It is noted that the broadening occurs in the high 
 molecular weight component. This is considered to be very 
 beneficial for bubble stability. 
 The resin Samples from examples 1 to 3 are compounded 
 on a LCM-100 line (Long Continuous Mixer/Gear Pump Pelletizing System (LCM-100 G) from Kobe Steel, Ltd. The 
 mixer is fitted with EL-2 type rotors from Same manufac 
 turer. Granular resin and additives are fed at room tempera 
 ture under controlled oxygen level at feed and vent ports. 
 The unit is typically run at 220 rpm, 10 to 40 percent gate 
 opening and mixer barrel temperature control). Precautions are taken to eliminate the possibility of tailoring (oxidative degradation) during the compounding step. The com 
 pounded resin Samples are then extruded in a 50 millimeter 
 Alpine TM film extruder having an 80 millimeter die and a 1.0 
 millimeter die gap, and evaluated. 
 The example 1 resin Sample runs at a maximum line Speed 
 of 105 feet per minute. The bubble is not stable at higher line Speeds and collapses. The dart impact Strength of this Sample 
 is measured at 240 grams on a 1 mil film. The film cannot be down gauged to 0.5 mill because of inferior bubble stability. These results verify that the precautions taken to avoid tailoring are adequate. 
 The examples 2 and 3 resin Samples demonstrate signifi cantly improved film properties. These samples run at a 
 maximum line Speed of 240 feet per minute. This represents 
 a 130 percent increase in bubble stability. The dart impact Strength of these Samples is measured at 290 grams on a 1 
 mil film. The film is Strong enough to be down gauged to 0.5 
 mil, and the dart impact Strength at 0.5 mil is measured at 305 grams. Both Samples result in Similar product proper 
 ties. 
 The Film Appearance Rating (FAR) is also very good, 
 ranging from plus 20 to plus 40, for the examples 2 and 3 resin samples and for the MDHMW (medium density, high molecular weight) resin Samples of example 5. Tensile Strength, Elmendorf tear, and percent elongation are also improved.

 The catalyst of examples 2 and 3 is also used to produce two medium density high molecular weight film products. 
 The reactor conditions and proceSS control methodology are 
 Similar to that used above for examples 2 and 3 except that adjustments are made in order to produce medium density 
 resins as opposed to high density resins, and the results are 
 Similar also. 
 The two MDHMW resin samples also demonstrate sig nificantly improved film properties. These samples exhibit 
 maximum line Speeds greater than 325 feet per Second representing a greater than 210 percent increase in line Speed 
 over the example 1 resin Sample. The dart impact Strength of 
 these samples at 0.8 and 0.35 mil are 470 grams and 376 grams, respectively, resulting in a normalized dart impact 
 strength of 599 and 1069 grams, respectively, at 1 mil. 
 EXAMPLE 6 
 The following are the conditions and properties for four 
 runs in which MDHMW resins are made. The catalyst is the Same as the one used in examples 2, 3, and 5. See Tables IX,

About 120 pounds of polyethylene having a flow index of 0.5 gram per 10 minutes and a density of 0.940 gram per cubic centimeter made with the example 1 catalyst are charged to a Second reactor as a seed bed. Comonomers are ethylene and 1-hexene. Both reactors are then purged with high purity nitrogen at 80 degrees C. for Several hours until the moisture content is below 10 ppm. Then, about 1500 cubic centimeters of 5 weight percent triethylaluminum (TEAL) in isopentane is charged to each reactor and circulated for a period of 4 hours. TEAL acts as a moisture Scavenger. The reactors are then given 2 high preSSure purges with nitrogen, and the conditions set forth in Table I are established in each reactor:\\nTABLE I\\nreactor\\ntemperature (C.)\\npressure (psia)\\nC2 partial pressure\\nH2/C2 molar ratio\\nC6, C2 molar ratio\\nisopentane (mol%)\\ngas velocity (ft/sec)\\nfirst reactor\\n85\\n300\\n25\\n0.04\\n0.027\\n12\\n1.75\\nsecond reactor\\n110\\n345\\n70\\n180\\n0.0075\\n1.70\\nApproximately 225 cubic centimeters per hour of 5 weight percent TEAL in isopentane are fed to the first reactor and 130 cubic centimeters per hour of 5 weight percent TEAL in isopentane are fed to the Second reactor to Serve as cocatalyst. Then, the example 1 catalyst feed is initiated at the rate of 7.5 cubic centimeters per hour using a slurry catalyst feeder. The ethylene partial pressure in the first reactor is manipulated to result in a production rate of 30 pounds per hour of resin. The H2/C2 molar ratio and C6/C2 molar ratio are manipulated in the first reactor to result in a resin with a flow index of 0.25 to 0.50 decigram per minute and a density of 0.927 to 0.930 gram per cubic centimeter. The Split in the resin exiting the Second reactor, i.e., the final product, is 60/40 (weight percent), i.e., 60 percent high molecular weight resin and 40 percent low molecular weight resin. This is accomplished by manipulating the production rate of resin in the Second reactor, which is, in turn, accomplished by adjusting the ethylene partial pressure. The melt index of the final product is about 800 grams per 10 minutes and the density is about 0.963 per cubic centimeter. At a total production rate of 50 pounds per hour (HMW+LMW), a total of 1100 pounds of resin are produced. The bulk resin properties are set forth in Table II as follows.

Comonomers are ethylene and 1-hexene. Both reactors are then purged with high purity nitrogen at 80 degrees C. for Several hours until the moisture content is below 10 ppm. Then, about 1500 cubic centimeters of 5 weight percent triethylaluminum (TEAL) in isopentane is charged to each reactor and circulated for a period of 4 hours. TEAL acts as a moisture Scavenger.

Then, the example 1 catalyst feed is initiated at the rate of 7.5 cubic centimeters per hour using a slurry catalyst feeder. The ethylene partial pressure in the first reactor is manipulated to result in a production rate of 30 pounds per hour of resin. The H2/C2 molar ratio and C6/C2 molar ratio are manipulated in the first reactor to result in a resin with a flow index of 0.25 to 0.50 decigram per minute and a density of 0.927 to 0.930 gram per cubic centimeter.

 bottom of the residence time pot. The impeller promotes Some radial mixing, but mainly assures that the bottom Section of the residence time pot does not experience SuS pended solid buildup. 
 After activator has been added to the catalyst precursor Slurry in one or two steps, additional activator is added as a last step prior to entry into the reactor. Preferably, this 
 addition occurs within 30 minutes and preferably within less than 15 minutes of actual injection of the catalyst precursor 
 Slurry into the reactor. The activator can be in Solution in an inert Solvent (Such as a high Viscosity fluid carrier or a lower Viscosity Solvent) or added as pure component. It is essential 
 that a mixer, preferably an additional Static mixer element, be located immediately downstream of the addition point of 
 the additional activator. It is also important to keep the Slurry flowing to assure that no plugs form in the catalyst feed line. 
 Additional activator is fed to provide for sufficient activation of the catalyst plus a Small additional amount to Scavenge 
 impurities in the polymerization reactor. The total amount of 
 this additional “topping off activator can be about 0.1 to 
 about 75 percent by mol of the total amount of the activator 
 used for the activation of the precursor. Addition of all of the activator to the catalyst precursor eliminates mass transfer problems, which would prevent the activator from reaching the catalyst precursor if Separate addition to the reactor was 
 practiced. This practice leads to extremely efficient utiliza tion of activator and improved polymer product properties. 
 After completion of the mixing of activator with catalyst 
 precursor, direct injection into the reactor occurs. Means of feeding a slurry to a gas phase reactor are well known and described in the art (see European Patent Application 635 521, for example). 
 The hydrocarbon used for the formation of the slurry can 
 be any essentially air and moisture free aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon which is unreactive with the catalyst precursor, 
 the precursor activator compounds, and the cocatalyst. In 
 practice, Since many of the final polymer products find end 
 uses in food packaging, aromatic hydrocarbons would not be a preferred slurry solvent. The hydrocarbon slurry solvent is 
 typically chosen from hydrogenated “mineral oils” or naph 
 thenic oils of relatively high Viscosity to minimize Settling of 
 catalyst Solids in feed tubes and the like, although, with appropriate engineering design, lower Viscosity Solvents 
 Such as isopentane, hexane, and heptane can be used as Slurry Solvents. These are not particularly preferred due to 
 the additional complexity introduced by use of a lower Viscosity and more easily Settled slurry as catalyst. The 
 viscosity of the hydrocarbon slurry solvent, however, is sufficiently low so that the slurry can be conveniently pumped through the pre-activation apparatus and eventually 
 into the polymerization reactor. Preferred Solvents are ali phatic hydrocarbons with viscosity greater than about 50 centipoises (cps), particularly greater than about 100 cps and 
 less than about 5,000 cps. Particularly preferred solvents are 
 napthenic mineral oils typified by materials Such as the Kaydol series of food grade mineral oils supplied by Witco 
 under the trademark Kaydol(R) 350 and 550. 
 It is preferred not to use a Support. However, in those 
 cases where it is desired to Support the precursor, Silica is the preferred Support. Other Suitable Supports are inorganic 
 oxides Such as aluminum phosphate, alumina, Silica/alumina mixtures, Silica modified with an organoaluminum com pound Such as triethylaluminum, and Silica modified with diethyl Zinc. A typical Support is a Solid, particulate, porous 
 material essentially inert to the polymerization. It is used as a dry powder having an average particle Size of about 10 to 
 about 250 microns and preferably about 30 to about 100 15

 microns, a Surface area of at least 200 Square meters per gram and preferably at least about 250 Square meters per 
 gram; and a pore Size of at least about 100 angstroms and preferably at least about 200 angstroms. Generally, the 
 amount of support used is that which will provide about 0.1 
 to about 1.0 millimole of titanium per gram of Support and 
 preferably about 0.4 to about 0.9 millimole of titanium per gram of Support. Impregnation of the above mentioned catalyst precursor into a Silica Support can be accomplished 
 by mixing the precursor and Silica gel in the electron donor 
 solvent or other solvent followed by solvent removal under reduced pressure. The resultant Solid catalyst is then con verted into a free flowing Slurry with an aliphatic hydrocar 
 bon as described above Such that it is pumpable as a liquid into the process. Catalyst precursorS Such as those described 
 in U.S. Pat. No. 5,290,745 and European Patent Application 771 820 are particularly useful in the process of subject 
 invention when placed into a hydrocarbon Slurry in the 
 unactivated State. 
 The polymerization is conducted in the gas phase using a 
 continuous fluidized bed process. 
 Melt index is determined under ASTM D-1238, Condition E. It is measured at 190° C. and 2.16 kilograms and reported as grams per 10 minutes or decigrams per minute. Flow 
 index is determined under ASTM D-1238, Condition F. It is 
 measured at 190° C. and 10 times the weight used in determining the melt index, and reported as grams per 10 
 minutes or decigrams per minute. Melt flow ratio is the ratio 
 of flow index to melt index. The product, as removed from 
 the reactor, can have a melt indeX in the range of about 0.02 to about 300 grams per 10 minutes, and preferably has a melt 
 index in the range of about >0.04 to about 50 grams per 10 
 minutes. The melt flow ratio is in the range of about 20 to about 50, and is preferably in the range of about 20 to about 30. The density of the polymer is normally at least 0.900 
 gram per cubic centimeter, and is preferably in the range of 
 0.915 to 0.960 gram per cubic centimeter. The bulk density 
 can be in the range of about 18 to about 32 pounds per cubic foot, and is preferably greater than 22 pounds per cubic foot. 
 The molecular weight distribution of the polymer is reflected 
 in an Mw/Mn of about 3 to about 7. Mw is the weight average molecular weight, Mn is the number average 
 molecular weight; and the Mw/Mn ratio can be referred to as the polydispersity index, which is a measure of the 
 breadth of the molecular weight distribution. Mw/Mn can 
 also be related to MFR, with lower values of MFR indicated 
 lower values of Mw/Mn and a narrower molecular weight 
 distribution. 
 The transition metal based catalyst System including the activated precursor, ethylene, and, optionally, alpha-olefin 
 and hydrogen are continuously fed into the reactor, and the 
 final product is continuously removed from the reactor. 
 In the reactor: 
 The mole ratio of alpha-olefin (if used) to ethylene can be in the range of about 0.01:1 to about 0.8:1, and is preferably 
 in the range of about 0.02:1 to about 0.35:1. The mole ratio of hydrogen (if used) to ethylene can be in the range of about 
 0.001:1 to about 2:1, and is preferably in the range of about 0.01 to about 0.5:1. Preferred operating temperatures vary 
 depending on the density desired, i.e., lower temperatures 
 for lower densities and higher temperatures for higher 
 densities. 
 The pressure, i.e., the total pressure in the reactor, can be in the range of about 200 to about 500 psig (pounds per Square inch gauge) and is preferably in the range of about 
 280 to about 450 psig. The ethylene partial pressure can be  US 6,617.405 B1 
 9 
 in the range of about 10 to about 150 psig, and is preferably 
 in the range of about >20 to about 120 psig. The balance of the total pressure is provided by alpha-olefin (if used) and an 
 inert gas Such as nitrogen. Other inert hydrocarbons, Such as an induced condensing agent e.g., isopentane, hexane also 
 contribute to the overall preSSure in the reactor according to their vapor pressure under the temperature and pressure 
 experienced in the reactor. A typical fluidized bed reactor 
 can be described as follows: 
 The bed is usually made up of the same granular resin that 
 is to be produced in the reactor. Thus, during the course of the polymerization, the bed comprises formed polymer particles, growing polymer particles, and catalyst particles 
 fluidized by polymerization and modifying gaseous compo 
 nents introduced at a flow rate or Velocity Sufficient to cause the particles to Separate and act as a fluid. The fluidizing gas 
 is made up of the initial feed, make-up feed, and cycle 
 (recycle) gas, i.e., comonomers and, if desired, modifiers and/or an inert carrier gas. 
 The essential parts of the reaction System are the vessel, 
 the bed, the gas distribution plate, inlet and outlet piping, a compressor, cycle gas cooler, and a product discharge SyS 
 tem. In the vessel, above the bed, there is a velocity 
 reduction Zone, and, in the bed, a reaction Zone. Both are above the gas distribution plate. 
 A typical fluidized bed reactor is further described in U.S. 
 Pat. No. 4,482,687. 
 The gaseous feed Streams of ethylene, other gaseous alpha-olefins (if used), and hydrogen (if used) are preferably fed to the reactor recycle line as well as liquid alpha-olefins (if used). The activated catalyst precursor is preferably 
 injected into the fluidized bed as a Solid or a mineral oil Slurry. The product composition can be varied by changing 
 the molar ratioS of the comonomers introduced into the 
 fluidized bed. The product is continuously discharged in 
 granular or particulate form from the reactor as the bed level builds up with polymerization. The production rate is con 
 trolled by adjusting the catalyst feed rate and/or the ethylene partial pressures. 
 The hydrogen:ethylene mole ratio can be adjusted to control average molecular weights. The alpha-olefins (other than ethylene) can be present in a total amount of up to 15 percent by weight of the copolymer and, if used, are pref 
 erably included in the copolymer in a total amount of about 1 to about 10 percent by weight based on the weight of the copolymer. 
 The residence time of the mixture of reactants including gaseous and liquid reactants, catalyst, and resin in the 
 fluidized bed can be in the range of about 1 to about 12 hours and is preferably in the range of about 2 to about 5 hours. 
 The reactor can be run in the condensing mode, if desired. 
 The condensing mode is described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,543, 
 399; 4,588,790; and 5,352,749. 
 The resin can be extruded in a conventional extruder 
 adapted for that purpose. Extruders and processes for extru 
 Sion are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,814, 135; 4,857,600; 
 5,076,988; and 5,153,382. Examples of various extruders, which can be used in forming film are a single Screw type 
 Such as one modified with a blown film die and air ring and continuous take off equipment, a blown film extruder, and a Slot cast extruder. A typical Single Screw type extruder can be described as one having a hopper at its upstream end and 
 a die at its downstream end. The hopper feeds into a barrel, 
 which contains a Screw. At the downstream end, between the 
 end of the Screw and the die, is a Screen pack and a breaker plate. The screw portion of the extruder is considered to be 15

 divided up into three Sections, the feed Section, the com pression Section, and the metering Section, and multiple 
 heating Zones from the rear heating Zone to the front heating 
 Zone, the multiple Sections and Zones running from upstream 
 to downstream. If it has more than one barrel, the barrels are 
 connected in Series. The length to diameter ratio of each barrel is in the range of about 16:1 to about 30:1. The extrusion can take place at temperatures in the range of 
 about 160 to about 270 degrees C., and is preferably carried 
 out at temperatures in the range of about 180 to about 240 degrees C. 
 The advantages of the invention are found in that molecu 
 lar weight distribution can be narrowed and hexane extract 
 ables can be decreased without a decrease in hydrogen response and catalyst activity; there is no rapid increase in 
 reaction rate, which can result in sheeting, chunking, and cessation of operation; reduction of the cocatalyst, i.e., activator, requirement; improved proceSS control; the pre 
 cursor is leSS Sensitive to over-reduction; catalyst fines are all active So they are less likely to Segregate and migrate to 
 the reactor wall to form sheets, facilitates activator change where different products are desired; the process allows for 
 complete activation even where the activator has very low (or nil) vapor pressure Such as tri-n-hexyl aluminum; the 
 process allows the use of leSS expensive activatorS Such as triethylaluminum and triusobutylaluminum; eliminates the 
 need for Separate cocatalyst feed; although the proceSS is 
 primarily focused on higher molecular weight (and lower levels of low molecular weight species), narrow molecular weight distribution products for fabrication into film, the process has broader application to higher melt indeX products, typically resins used in injection molding, elimi 
 nates other forms of catalyst premixing, often a unit opera tion; and allows for quick changes of catalyst by changing 
 relative flow rates of precursor and activator. 
 Conventional additives, which can be introduced into the resin product, are exemplified by antioxidants, ultraViolet absorbers, pigments, dyes, nucleating agents, fillers, Slip 
 agents, fire retardants, plasticizers, processing aids, 
 lubricants, Stabilizers, Smoke inhibitors, Viscosity control agents, and crosslinking agents, catalysts, and boosters, 
 tackifiers, and anti-blocking agents. Aside from the fillers, 
 the additives can be present in the blend in amounts of about 0.1 to about 10 parts by weight of additive for each 100 parts 
 by weight of polymer blend. Fillers can be added in amounts up to 200 parts by weight and more for each 100 parts by 
 weight of the blend.

 EXAMPLES 1 to 4 
 Examples 1 to 4 are embodiments of the invention. In these examples, a Small polymerization reaction System, as 
 described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,290,745 and references con 
 tained therein, is used. Instead of manipulating the activator/ 
 electron donor ratioS in an in-line fashion as indicated in the 
 discussion of the preferred mode, the partially activated precursors are prepared in a batch fashion due to the extreme difficulty encountered in metering activator compound flows 
 which would be at rates of about 1 to 3 cubic centimeters per 
 hour. These results are illustrative of the effect of the 
 invention in manipulating polymer properties in an in-line  US 6,617.405 B1

 fashion over a larger range of polymer MFR (melt flow ratio), hexane extractables, and polymer bulk density. The Smaller reaction System is used illustratively to avoid experi 
 mentation in large commercial equipment, which can result in large amounts of off-specification polymer during the 
 experiment. The results described below, however, are directly Scalable to large Scale commercial reaction Systems. 
 Note: ratioS are mole ratioS unless otherwise Stated. 
 Catalyst Precursor Preparation 
 A titanium trichloride containing catalyst precursor is 
 prepared in a 1900 liter vessel equipped with pressure and temperature controls and a turbine agitator. A nitrogen 
 atmosphere (less than 5 ppm H2O) is maintained at all times. 1480 liters of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (THF, the internal 
 electron donor) containing less than 40 ppm H2O are added to the vessel. The THF is heated to a temperature of 50 degrees C., and 1.7 kilograms of granular magnesium metal 
 (70.9 gram atoms) are added, followed by 27.2 kilograms of titanium tetrachloride (137 mols). The magnesium metal has a particle size in the range of from 0.1 to 4 millimeters. The 
 titanium tetrachloride is added over a period of about 
 one-half hour. 
 The mixture is continuously agitated. The exotherm 
 resulting from the addition of titanium tetrachloride causes the temperature of the mixture to rise to approximately 72 
 degrees C. Over a period of about three hours. The tempera 
 ture is held at about 70 degrees C. by heating for approxi 
 mately another four hours. At the end of this time, 61.7 kilograms of magnesium dichloride (540 moles) are added and heating is continued at 70 degrees C. for another eight 
 hours. The mixture (solution) is then filtered through a 100 micron filter to remove undissolved magnesium dichloride and unreacted magnesium (less than 0.5 percent by weight). 
 100 kilograms of fumed Silica having a particle Size in the 
 range of from 0.1 to 1 microns are added to the mixture prepared above over a period of about two hours. The 
 mixture is stirred by means of a turbine agitator during this 
 time and for Several hours thereafter to thoroughly disperse 
 the Silica in the Solution. The temperature of the mixture is held at 70 degrees C. throughout this period and a nitrogen 
 atmosphere is maintained at all times. 
 The resulting Slurry is spray dried using an 8-foot diam 
 eter closed cycle spray dryer equipped with a rotary atom izer. The rotary atomizer is adjusted to give catalyst particles 
 with a D50 of 18 microns. The scrubber section of the spray dryer is maintained at approximately minus 4 degrees C. 
 Nitrogen gas is introduced into the Spray dryer at an inlet 
 temperature of 165 degrees C. and is circulated at a rate of approximately 1700 kilograms per hour. The catalyst Slurry 
 is fed to the Spray dryer at a temperature of about 35 degrees 
 C. and a rate of 90 to 95 kilograms per hour, or sufficient to yield an outlet gas temperature of approximately 125 
 degrees C. The atomization pressure is slightly above atmo Spheric. Discrete Spray dried catalyst precursor particles are 
 formed. 
 The Spray dried catalyst precursor contains 2.5 weight percent Ti, 6.3 weight percent Mg, and 25 to 29 weight 
 percent THF. The particles have a D50 of 14 microns and a span (D90-D10)/D50 ranging from 0.75 to 1.25 as deter mined by means of a Leeds and Northrup Microtrac(R) particle size analyzer using a dodecane Solvent, The discrete 
 catalyst precursor particles are mixed with mineral oil under 
 a nitrogen atmosphere in a 400 liter vessel equipped with a turbine agitator to form a slurry containing approximately 28 
 weight percent of the Solid catalyst precursor. 15

 To partially activate the catalyst Slurry, a 50 weight 
 percent solution of tri-n-hexylaluminum (TnHAI) in mineral 
 oil is added to the slurry followed by mixing for approxi 
 mately 72 hour. The TnHAI solution is employed in an 
 amount sufficient to provide 0.20 mole of TnHAI per mole of THF in the catalyst. Sequentially, then a 30 weight 
 percent solution of diethylaluminum chloride (DEAC) in 
 mineral oil is added and the mixture is mixed and held for 
 approximately 1 hour. The DEAC is employed in an amount 
 sufficient to provide 0.45 mole of DEAC per mole of THF 
 in the catalyst. The mole ratio of total activator (TnHAI plus 
 DEAC) to THF is 0.65:1. 
 Ethylene is copolymerized with 1-butene in a fluidized 
 bed reactor as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,349,648. Each polymerization is continuously conducted after equilibrium 
 is reached under conditions set forth in Table I. Polymer 
 ization is initiated in the reactor by continuously feeding the 
 above preactivated catalyst precursor into a fluidized bed of 
 polyethylene granules together with ethylene, 1-hexene, and 
 hydrogen. In example 1, an activator (in this case, a 
 cocatalyst) is dissolved in isopentane (iC5) and fed to reactor Separately from the preactivated catalyst. 
 Example 1 is repeated in examples 2 to 4 with the 
 exception that the activator is now admixed with the catalyst 
 in a final Step prior to addition to the reactor. Preactivated 
 catalyst and triethylaluminum activator are mixed in-line for 
 approximately 1 to 1.5 minutes. No external activator is fed 
 to the reactor. The reaction conditions are set forth in Table 
 I. The MFR and the bulk density are shown in Table II. It 
 will be noted that the MFR and bulk density of the blend 
 change with changes in the total activator/electron donor 
 mole ratio with little change in other polymer properties or 
 reaction conditions. Although the change in MFR is Small, 
 changes of this kind can have significant effects on end use 
 properties as indicated in U.S. Pat. No. 4,349,648, men 
 tioned above. The change in Settled bulk density is greater with the highest bulk density (example 4) occurring at the 
 lowest total activator/electron donor mole ratio.

 EXAMPLES 5 to 9 
 Examples 5 to 9 are also embodimets of the invention. Catalyst is prepared as in Example 1. The Same reaction 
 System is used. In these examples, however, 1-hexene is used as comonomer and trimethylaluminum as activator. In the control (example 5), the activator (cocatalyst) is fed Separately to the fluidized bed as a Solution in isopentane. 15 14 
 U.S. Pat. No. 5,068,489 is used in Comparative Examples 1, 
 3, 5, and 6. In the examples using a Silica impregnated 
 catalyst, the catalyst is introduced to the reactor as a dry 
 powder. In Comparative Examples 2, 4, 7, and 8, the catalyst 
 is fed to the reactor as a slurry. In these examples, the 
 activator (cocatalyst) is fed separately to the polymerizing 
 bed. The spray dried slurry fed catalyst of Comparative 
 Examples 2, 4, 7, and 8 is normally of higher productivity 
 and hence lower residual titanium level than the Silica 
 impregnated catalyst. This is illustrated by comparing Com 
 parative Examples 1 and 2. Note, that despite Similar reac 
 tion conditions, much higher residual titanium levels are 
 observed at these low activator:Timolar ratios, even though 
 the activator:ED molar ratios are much higher than those in Examples 1 to 9 illustrating the invention; also note the 
 substantially lower residual titanium for the catalysts of the 
 invention. Thus, a much more efficacious use of cocatalyst 
 activator is achieved by the process of the invention, as well 
 0 as achieving the same results in terms of reduced MFR i.e., 
 narrower molecular weight distribution (MWD) and lower hexane extractables. Both catalyst productivity and activa 
 tor utilization effectiveneSS are improved through addition of 
 the activator directly with the activated catalyst precursor composition in a hydrocarbon slurry.

 time (min) 
 Examples 6 to 9 utilize activator mixed directly with the 
 preactivated catalyst in-line prior to introduction to the TABLE IV reactor. Since all of these examples use trimethylaluminum as activator, the effect of the invention on MFR is more 55 - Examples 
 difficult to ascertain Since this particular activator normally 
 gives low MFR values under any set of circumstances. The 
 effect on bulk density, however, is still clear as is the relatively high catalyst productivity observed, even at very 
 low Al/Tilevels. Variables and results can be found in Tables 
 III and IV.

The atomization pressure is slightly above atmospheric. Discrete Spray dried catalyst precursor particles are formed. The Spray dried catalyst precursor contains 2.5 weight percent Ti, 6.3 weight percent Mg, and 25 to 29 weight percent THF.

The TnHAI solution is employed in an amount sufficient to provide 0.20 mole of TnHAI per mole of THF in the catalyst.

In these examples, a Small polymerization reaction System, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,290,745 and references contained therein, is used. Instead of manipulating the activator/electron donor ratioS in an in-line fashion as indicated in the discussion of the preferred mode, the partially activated precursors are prepared in a batch fashion due to the extreme difficulty encountered in metering activator compound flows which would be at rates of about 1 to 3 cubic centimeters per hour. These results are illustrative of the effect of the invention in manipulating polymer properties in an in-line fashion over a larger range of polymer MFR (melt flow ratio), hexane extractables, and polymer bulk density. The Smaller reaction System is used illustratively to avoid experimentation in large commercial equipment, which can result in large amounts of off-specification polymer during the experiment. The results described below, however, are directly Scalable to large Scale commercial reaction Systems. Note: ratioS are mole ratioS unless otherwise Stated. Catalyst Precursor Preparation A titanium trichloride containing catalyst precursor is prepared in a 1900 liter vessel equipped with pressure and temperature controls and a turbine agitator. A nitrogen atmosphere (less than 5 ppm H2O) is maintained at all times. 1480 liters of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (THF, the internal electron donor) containing less than 40 ppm H2O are added to the vessel. The THF is heated to a temperature of 50 degrees C., and 1.7 kilograms of granular magnesium metal (70.9 gram atoms) are added, followed by 27.2 kilograms of titanium tetrachloride (137 mols). The magnesium metal has a particle size in the range of from 0.1 to 4 millimeters. The titanium tetrachloride is added over a period of about one-half hour. The mixture is continuously agitated. The exotherm resulting from the addition of titanium tetrachloride causes the temperature of the mixture to rise to approximately 72 degrees C. Over a period of about three hours. The temperature is held at about 70 degrees C. by heating for approximately another four hours. At the end of this time, 61.7 kilograms of magnesium dichloride (540 moles) are added and heating is continued at 70 degrees C. for another eight hours. The mixture (solution) is then filtered through a 100 micron filter to remove undissolved magnesium dichloride and unreacted magnesium (less than 0.5 percent by weight). 100 kilograms of fumed Silica having a particle Size in the range of from 0.1 to 1 microns are added to the mixture prepared above over a period of about two hours. The mixture is stirred by means of a turbine agitator during this time and for Several hours thereafter to thoroughly disperse the Silica in the Solution. The temperature of the mixture is held at 70 degrees C. throughout this period and a nitrogen atmosphere is maintained at all times. The resulting Slurry is spray dried using an 8-foot diameter closed cycle spray dryer equipped with a rotary atom izer. The rotary atomizer is adjusted to give catalyst particles with a D50 of 18 microns. The scrubber section of the spray dryer is maintained at approximately minus 4 degrees C. Nitrogen gas is introduced into the Spray dryer at an inlet temperature of 165 degrees C. and is circulated at a rate of approximately 1700 kilograms per hour. The catalyst Slurry is fed to the Spray dryer at a temperature of about 35 degrees C. and a rate of 90 to 95 kilograms per hour, or sufficient to yield an outlet gas temperature of approximately 125 degrees C. The atomization pressure is slightly above atmospheric. Discrete Spray dried catalyst precursor particles are formed. The Spray dried catalyst precursor contains 2.5 weight percent Ti, 6.3 weight percent Mg, and 25 to 29 weight percent THF. The particles have a D50 of 14 microns and a span (D90-D10)/D50 ranging from 0.75 to 1.25 as deter mined by means of a Leeds and Northrup Microtrac(R) particle size analyzer using a dodecane Solvent, The discrete catalyst precursor particles are mixed with mineral oil under a nitrogen atmosphere in a 400 liter vessel equipped with a turbine agitator to form a slurry containing approximately 28 weight percent of the Solid catalyst precursor. 15 To partially activate the catalyst Slurry, a 50 weight percent solution of tri-n-hexylaluminum (TnHAI) in mineral oil is added to the slurry followed by mixing for approxi mately 72 hour. The TnHAI solution is employed in an amount sufficient to provide 0.20 mole of TnHAI per mole of THF in the catalyst. Sequentially, then a 30 weight percent solution of diethylaluminum chloride (DEAC) in mineral oil is added and the mixture is mixed and held for approximately 1 hour. The DEAC is employed in an amount sufficient to provide 0.45 mole of DEAC per mole of THF in the catalyst. The mole ratio of total activator (TnHAI plus DEAC) to THF is 0.65:1. Ethylene is copolymerized with 1-butene in a fluidized bed reactor as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,349,648. Each polymerization is continuously conducted after equilibrium is reached under conditions set forth in Table I. Polymer ization is initiated in the reactor by continuously feeding the above preactivated catalyst precursor into a fluidized bed of polyethylene granules together with ethylene, 1-hexene, and hydrogen. In example 1, an activator (in this case, a cocatalyst) is dissolved in isopentane (iC5) and fed to reactor Separately from the preactivated catalyst. Example 1 is repeated in examples 2 to 4 with the exception that the activator is now admixed with the catalyst in a final Step prior to addition to the reactor. Preactivated catalyst and triethylaluminum activator are mixed in-line for approximately 1 to 1.5 minutes. No external activator is fed to the reactor. The reaction conditions are set forth in Table I. The MFR and the bulk density are shown in Table II. It will be noted that the MFR and bulk density of the blend change with changes in the total activator/electron donor mole ratio with little change in other polymer properties or reaction conditions. Although the change in MFR is Small, changes of this kind can have significant effects on end use properties as indicated in U.S. Pat. No. 4,349,648, men tioned above. The change in Settled bulk density is greater with the highest bulk density (example 4) occurring at the lowest total activator/electron donor mole ratio.', type='polymerization', reference=['Example 1'], table_data=None), ExperimentInfo(id='Example 5 to 9', text_of_example='EXAMPLES 5 to 9 Examples 5 to 9 are also embodimets of the invention. Catalyst is prepared as in Example 1. The Same reaction System is used. In these examples, however, 1-hexene is used as comonomer and trimethylaluminum as activator. In the control (example 5), the activator (cocatalyst) is fed Separately to the fluidized bed as a Solution in isopentane. 15 14 U.S. Pat. No. 5,068,489 is used in Comparative Examples 1, 3, 5, and 6. In the examples using a Silica impregnated catalyst, the catalyst is introduced to the reactor as a dry powder. In Comparative Examples 2, 4, 7, and 8, the catalyst is fed to the reactor as a slurry. In these examples, the activator (cocatalyst) is fed separately to the polymerizing bed. The spray dried slurry fed catalyst of Comparative Examples 2, 4, 7, and 8 is normally of higher productivity and hence lower residual titanium level than the Silica impregnated catalyst. This is illustrated by comparing Com parative Examples 1 and 2. Note, that despite Similar reac tion conditions, much higher residual titanium levels are observed at these low activator:Timolar ratios, even though the activator:ED molar ratios are much higher than those in Examples 1 to 9 illustrating the invention; also note the substantially lower residual titanium for the catalysts of the invention. Thus, a much more efficacious use of cocatalyst activator is achieved by the process of the invention, as well as achieving the same results in terms of reduced MFR i.e., narrower molecular weight distribution (MWD) and lower hexane extractables.

The Spray dried catalyst precursor contains 2.5 weight percent Ti, 6.3 weight percent Mg, and 25 to 29 weight percent THF. The particles have a D50 of 14 microns and a span (D90-D10)/D50 ranging from 0.75 to 1.25 as deter mined by means of a Leeds and Northrup Microtrac(R) particle size analyzer using a dodecane Solvent, The discrete catalyst precursor particles are mixed with mineral oil under a nitrogen atmosphere in a 400 liter vessel equipped with a turbine agitator to form a slurry containing approximately 28 weight percent of the Solid catalyst precursor. 15 To partially activate the catalyst Slurry, a 50 weight percent solution of tri-n-hexylaluminum (TnHAI) in mineral oil is added to the slurry followed by mixing for approxi mately 72 hour. The TnHAI solution is employed in an amount sufficient to provide 0.20 mole of TnHAI per mole of THF in the catalyst. Sequentially, then a 30 weight percent solution of diethylaluminum chloride (DEAC) in mineral oil is added and the mixture is mixed and held for approximately 1 hour. The DEAC is employed in an amount sufficient to provide 0.45 mole of DEAC per mole of THF in the catalyst. The mole ratio of total activator (TnHAI plus DEAC) to THF is 0.65:1. Ethylene is copolymerized with 1-butene in a fluidized bed reactor as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,349,648. Each polymerization is continuously conducted after equilibrium is reached under conditions set forth in Table I. Polymer ization is initiated in the reactor by continuously feeding the above preactivated catalyst precursor into a fluidized bed of polyethylene granules together with ethylene, 1-hexene, and hydrogen. In example 1, an activator (in this case, a cocatalyst) is dissolved in isopentane (iC5) and fed to reactor Separately from the preactivated catalyst. Example 1 is repeated in examples 2 to 4 with the exception that the activator is now admixed with the catalyst in a final Step prior to addition to the reactor. Preactivated catalyst and triethylaluminum activator are mixed in-line for approximately 1 to 1.5 minutes. No external activator is fed to the reactor. The reaction conditions are set forth in Table I. The MFR and the bulk density are shown in Table II. It will be noted that the MFR and bulk density of the blend change with changes in the total activator/electron donor mole ratio with little change in other polymer properties or reaction conditions. Although the change in MFR is Small, changes of this kind can have significant effects on end use properties as indicated in U.S. Pat. No. 4,349,648, men tioned above. The change in Settled bulk density is greater with the highest bulk density (example 4) occurring at the lowest total activator/electron donor mole ratio.', type='polymerization', reference=['Example 1'], table_data=None), ExperimentInfo(id='Example 5 to 9', text_of_example='EXAMPLES 5 to 9 Examples 5 to 9 are also embodimets of the invention. Catalyst is prepared as in Example 1. The Same reaction System is used. In these examples, however, 1-hexene is used as comonomer and trimethylaluminum as activator. In the control (example 5), the activator (cocatalyst) is fed Separately to the fluidized bed as a Solution in isopentane. 15 14 U.S. Pat. No. 5,068,489 is used in Comparative Examples 1, 3, 5, and 6. In the examples using a Silica impregnated catalyst, the catalyst is introduced to the reactor as a dry powder. In Comparative Examples 2, 4, 7, and 8, the catalyst is fed to the reactor as a slurry. In these examples, the activator (cocatalyst) is fed separately to the polymerizing bed. The spray dried slurry fed catalyst of Comparative Examples 2, 4, 7, and 8 is normally of higher productivity and hence lower residual titanium level than the Silica impregnated catalyst. This is illustrated by comparing Com parative Examples 1 and 2. Note, that despite Similar reac tion conditions, much higher residual titanium levels are observed at these low activator:Timolar ratios, even though the activator:ED molar ratios are much higher than those in Examples 1 to 9 illustrating the invention; also note the substantially lower residual titanium for the catalysts of the invention. Thus, a much more efficacious use of cocatalyst activator is achieved by the process of the invention, as well as achieving the same results in terms of reduced MFR i.e., narrower molecular weight distribution (MWD) and lower hexane extractables. Both catalyst productivity and activa tor utilization effectiveneSS are improved through addition of the activator directly with the activated catalyst precursor composition in a hydrocarbon slurry.', type='polymerization', reference=['Example 1'], table_data=None), ExperimentInfo(id='Table I and Table II', text_of_example='TABLE I Example REACTION 1.

 quantity used of this reducing agent can control the amount of 
 titanium fixed on silica at the final catalyst. In the next step of the process according to the present 
 invention, the Suspension obtained in (d) or (e), which is still under stirring, is put in contact and interacted with one or more halogenating agents.

 solvent, preferably at 60° C. According to the present invention, in step (g) of the pro 
 cess, the Solid obtained in (f) is kept under higher temperature 
 that depends on the inert organic solvent used.

 Optionally, the solid obtained in (h) is washed with a solu tion of organometallic compounds of the groups 1, 2, 12 or 13. 
 More specifically, in the optional step (i) the solid obtained in 
 step (h) is suspended in an inert organic solvent such as 
 hexane or heptane, and it is put in contact with one or more organometallic compounds of the groups 1, 2, 12 or 13 of the periodic table, preferably metal-alkyl compounds or metal

 Solution or in individual Solutions, at the same time or in Subsequent additions. 
 The amount of the metal-alkyl halide compound of the groups 1, 2, 12 or 13 or metal-alkyl compound of the groups 
 1, 2, 12 or 13, used in the step (i) of the process corresponds 
 to the amount ranging from 0 to 3 g of the corresponding metal-alkyl halide compound of the groups 1, 2, 12 or 13 or

 nomagnesium, organolithium and organozinc compounds, 
 pure or in mixtures. The particle size distribution of the solid catalyst compo 
 nent of the present invention is very close to the silica used as carrier and, as consequence, its average particle size ranges 
 also from 10 to 120 um. The solid catalyst component surface area ranges from 80 to 300 m/g and its pore volume ranges 
 from 0.1 to 1.0 ml/g. The catalyst component of the present invention is Suitable for using in liquid phase or gas phase, ethylene polymeriza 
 tion process. The co-catalyst used in the polymerization pro 
 cess is an alkyl-aluminum, preferably trimethyl aluminum or 
 triethyl aluminum. The mass ratio co-catalyst:catalyst in the polymerization process is between 0.5:1 and 6.0:1. 
 An important feature is its ability to produce, when sub 
 mitted to polymerization conditions, particles of homo and copolymers of ethylene with controlled morphology having 
 high bulk density and containing a very Small quantity of 
 fines. This feature allows the use of this catalyst in a process where the catalyst can be fed directly into the polymerization 
 reactor. Particular forms to feed the catalyst are in dry bulk powder, in paste, in oil Suspension or in solvent Suspension. 
 As an alternative the catalyst can be prepolymerized with 
 ethylene or propylene and optionally with a comonomer 
 before being fed into the reactor. Another important feature of the present invention is its tolerance to the high electrostatic charges occurring in gas 
 phase reactors. This feature helps to prevent the formation of 
 polymer sheets or agglomerates on the reactor walls. The 
 good catalytic yield and the low decay kinetics observed for 
 the present invention, allows its use in most polymerization processes, including processes operating in more than one 
 reactor in series. 
 A further feature characteristic of the catalyst of the present invention is when using a microspheroidal silica as Support 
 the catalyst obtained has also a spheroidal morphology and in consequence a polymer product with good morphology and 
 flowability is obtained. 
 The catalyst component of the present invention is advan tageously used in the polymerization of ethylene and mix 
 tures thereof with alpha-olefins CH2=CHR, wherein R is an alkyl or cicloalkyl or aryl radical with 1-12 carbon atoms 
 because it has a high activity and low decay kinetics. In particular, it is used in the preparation of: High density polyethylenes (HDPE, having a density greater than 0.940 g/cm), particularly with narrow 
 molecular weight distribution (MFR-27), including homopolymers of ethylene and copolymers of ethylene 
 with one or more alpha-olefins having from 3 to 14 
 carbon atoms. These products are particularly Suitable for thermoforming and injection applications; 
 Linear medium density and linear low density polyethyl 
 enes (LMDPE and LLDPE, having a density lower than 0.940 g/cm) most specifically very low and ultra low 
 density linear polyethylenes (VLDPE and ULDPE, hav ing a density lower than 0.920 g/cm and as low as 0.880 g/m) consisting of copolymers of ethylene with one or 
 more alpha-olefins having from 3 to 14 carbon atoms, having a content of units derived from ethylene greater than approximately 80% by weight. These products 10

 have an improved structure due to the very good 
 comonomer insertion and, in most cases, they have also 
 a narrow molecular weight distribution (MFR-27). 
 Hence the low xylene soluble contents are obtained, allowing the production of films with superior optical 
 properties and very low blocking. The LMDPE products are particularly useful for rotomolding applications; 
 Elastomeric copolymers of ethylene and propylene and 
 elastomeric terpolymers of ethylene and propylene with 
 minor amounts of a diene, having a content of units derived from ethylene comprised between about 30 and 70% by weight.

 the solid was once again Suspended in 2200 ml of anhydrous 
 hexane and then 30 g of Tn-HAL (0.106 moles) in 200 ml of anhydrous hexane were added to the resulting Suspension 
 under gently stirring. Contact was maintained for 50 min at room temperature. Finally, the Supernatant liquid was 
 removed and the solid was dried at 60°C. under nitrogen flow thus giving 340 g of a brown-reddish powder. 
 The chemical and physical characteristics of the resulting 
 reddish powder were as follows:

 Example 10 
 In a 5 liter flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer and previ ously purged with nitrogen were fed 24 g (0.252 moles) of 
 anhydrous MgCl, and 180 ml (0.528 moles) of Ti(OBu). 
 This mixture was allowed to stir at 300 rpm and heated to 150° C. for about 12 hours in order to have the solids completely dissolved, thereby a clear liquid product was obtained. This 
 resulting liquid was cooled down to 40°C. and under gently stirring at 150 rpm, it was diluted with 3200 ml of anhydrous 
 hexane. Into this solution kept at 40° C. and under the same stirring, 300g of the silica support were added. This silica was 
 previously dehydrated and treated with 23 ml (0.167 moles) of triethylaluminum diluted in anhydrous hexane, for 50 min 
 utes and at room temperature. Once the addition of the silica 
 is completed, the mixture was heated to 60° C. and kept at this 
 temperature for 1 hour. To this mixture a solution of 100 ml of 
 anhydrous hexane and 100 ml of SiCl, (0.873 moles) was dropped over a period of time of 1 hour. At the end of the 
 addition, stirring was continued for 3.5 hours at a temperature of 60°C. The temperature of the mixture was then brought to 
 65° C. and kept for additional 2 hours. After cooling the mixture to room temperature, the stirring was stopped to have 
 the solid settled. The supernatant liquid was removed, and the 
 solid was repeatedly washed with anhydrous hexane. The 5

 Pilot Plant Tests 
 A pilot plant continuously operated was used to prepare 
 LLDPE as shown in FIG. 2. 
 A fluidized bed gas phase reactor 1 with 45 cm of internal 
 diameter and 120 cm of reaction Zone height is fed by a dry-solid catalyst feeder 2. The bed of polymer particles in 
 reaction Zone3 is kept in fluidized state by a recycle stream 4 
 that works as a fluidizing medium as well as a dissipating heat 
 agent for absorbing the exothermal heat generated within 
 reaction Zone 3. The Superficial velocity of the gas, resulting 
 from the flow rate of recycle stream 4 within reactor 1 is 0.7 10 
 15 
 m/s. Stream5, which contains the gas discharged from reactor 20 
 1, said gas having low monomer contents, is fed to the Suction 
 of compressor 6. The combined reaction and compression 
 heats are then removed from recycle stream 5 in an external 
 heat exchange system 7 in order to control the reactor tem

 perature. The composition of stream 5 is kept constant to yield a polymer with the required specifications. 
 Make-up components are fed to the system at spot 8 so as 
 to make up the composition of recycle stream 5. So, make-up 
 stream 8 will include the triethyl aluminum (TEAL) that 
 directly reacts in a ratio of 2 moles of TEAL per mole of 
 catalyst. Also at the spot 8, propane is fed as the selected 
 non-reactive compound required to maintain the total pres 
 Sure of the system. 
 The polymerization catalyst is introduced as a dry powder 
 by a catalyst feeder into reactor 1 in a site within the reaction Zone 3, close to the distributing plate 9 in a rate to control the residence time of the catalyst. The reactive gases, including 
 ethylene and comonomers are introduced at the spot 10. 60

 The produced polymer is discharged from the reaction Zone through a discharge system 11 that provides the recovery 
 of the reactive and non-reactive gases, recycling said gases back to the recycle stream 5 at spot 12 and lowers the pressure of the discharged mixture of polymer and gases at certain pressure for later conveying the produced polymer particles 
 13 for downward sampling. 
 Examples 13 to 23 
 The examples 13 to 23 were conducted in the gas phase pilot reactor at 88°C., using in each EXAMPLE respectively the catalysts produced in the EXAMPLES 1 to 10. The cata lyst produced in the EXAMPLE 10 was also used in the pilot polymerization at 75° C. as shown in the EXAMPLE 23. In all examples the pilot reactor run was performed Smoothly, with good catalytic yield and no agglomerates or 
 sheets were formed. The polymers obtained had a good mor 
 phology and, in most cases, less than 1% of fines (<250 um). The films obtained with these polymers presented very good optical properties and a low blocking strength. 
 During the performance of the EXAMPLE 20 it was per 
 formed a decay test and the measured half-life time was 3.8 
 hours. 
 The results are shown in table 1.
