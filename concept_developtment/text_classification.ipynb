         "US 6,617.405 B1 \n 1 \n PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF \n POLYETHYLENE \n TECHNICAL FIELD \n This invention relates to a proceSS for the preparation of \n polyethylene with a focus on catalyst activation. \n BACKGROUND INFORMATION \n Polyethylene has long been prepared with Ziegler-Natta \n catalyst Systems, which typically include a catalyst precur \n Sor made up of transition metal(s) and an electron donor, and a cocatalyst. In order to obtain the high level of catalyst activity essential to commercial polymerization processes, it \n is necessary to provide for essentially complete activation of \n the precursor. It should be noted, however, that catalyst \n activity in these Systems is also affected by a number of \n other variables including the method of catalyst manufacture \n or formation, the use of internal electron donors, the chemi \n cal composition of the internal electron donor, and the total \n amount of internal electron donor. \n Once the basic catalyst is formed, it is necessary to \n remove internal electron donor from the vicinity of the active site and (if necessary) chlorinate and/or reduce the \n valence site of the active metal. Electron donor (ED) is complexed or reacted away from the active Site by either activator compound (defined as an Al compound which is capable of reducing TiCl, to Ti\" valency; such compounds \n can be generically described as RAIX, wherein X is a halogen, typically Cl; n ranges from 1 to 3 with preferred \n values ranging from 1.5 to 3; and R is preferably CH, CH5, \n iCHo, nC. Ho, nCH, or nGHz) or by a Lewis acid (typically RMX, wherein n+m=the valency of M; R is an alkyl or alkoxy or aryloxy group; X is a halogen; and M=B, \n Al, or Si). The formula of a non-activator Lewis Acid can be RBX, wherein X=0 to 2. It is desirable to supply sufficient \n activator or Lewis acid to remove at least 90 percent and preferably close to 100 percent of the ED compound from \n the active site. Due to chemical equilibria, it may be nec essary to add a greater than Stoichiometric amount of \n activator compound to electron donor to fully activate the catalyst. Activation can be accomplished by partial activa \n tion before introduction of the precursor into the reactor and \n completion of the activation in the reactor by means of the cocatalyst, or full activation prior to introduction of the \n precursor into the reactor. \n The disadvantages of partial activation lie in the require ment for additional proceSS StepS and equipment to provide \n the partially activated precursor followed by final activation \n in the reactor, which requires excessive amounts of activator compound, i.e., cocatalyst (typically, aluminum alkyl \n compounds), to be added to the reactor So that an adequate \n concentration of activator compound is present at the active \n polymerization site. AS noted above, the function of this activator compound is to extract electron donor compound \n from the potential active site and to activate the active site either by alkylation (if the active site is already at the correct Valence State) or by reduction and alkylation if the active site valence state requires reduction, for example, from Ti\" to Ti\". In addition to being wasteful, this excess activator compound can cause operational problems or detriment to \n the final product. \n Typical preactivated catalysts are described in U.S. Pat. \n Nos. 4,482,687; 4,508,842; and 5,290,745. Preactivated catalysts of the prior art can be formulated with sufficient activator compound to fully activate the precursor compo 15 \n 25 \n 35 \n 40 \n 45 \n 50 \n 55 \n 60 \n 65 2 \n Sition; however, putting large amounts of activator com pound directly onto these catalysts can also result in \n deactivation, catalysts which are hazardous to handle due to pyrophoricity, or catalysts which have poor flow properties. \n Some of these disadvantages can be addressed by dispersing the catalyst in a carrier Such as an inert hydrocarbon; however, the disadvantage of needing multiple operations to produce the catalyst and the inability to adjust the final \n catalyst composition to account for variations in monomer \n quality are Serious limitations for commercial operation. A \n further limitation for commercial operation is the need to dilute the catalyst sufficiently with the inert hydrocarbon to \n prevent deactivation of the catalyst due to high concentra tion of activator compound in the catalyst Slurry. \n The use of excess amounts of cocatalyst in Ziegler-Natta catalyzed polymerizations is Standard practice in the art. \n Typical Al/Ti molar ratios used in prior art processes are \n usually greater than 20:1, and many are in the 50:1 to 100:1 range. In the description of these processes, lower values are \n mentioned, but clearly are not preferred. In other prior art, \n very low levels of added aluminum alkyl ranging from 0.1:1 to about 10:1 are Suggested, but the catalyst Systems \n involved here are devoid of electron donor type compounds, \n and So are not relevant to the processes under discussion in this specification. A typical non-ED System is described in \n U.S. Pat. No. 5,077,358. \n Prepolymerization Systems are also mentioned in the prior \n art. Typical examples of this kind of catalyst System are \n mentioned in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,077,358 and 4,990,479. These \n Systems also do not use internal electron donors, and addi tion of extra aluminum alkyl activator component can lead to catalyst productivity increases to Such an extent that \n Severe operational instabilities are observed. These catalysts are typically activated in the prepolymer preparation with \n low amounts of an aluminum alkyl activator compound and \n frequently with the use of an external electron donor. While “free” aluminum alkyl may be removed from the prepoly \n mer prior to use in the main polymerization reactor, the prepolymer catalysts are fully activated in the reactor with \n large exceSS amounts of cocatalyst. \n European Patent Application 783 007 discloses a process for production of polyethylene using reduced amounts of \n aluminum alkyl feed; however, this disclosure focuses exclusively on the use of external addition of additional activator compound, i.e., Separate activator and catalyst \n feeds, and overall Al/Timolar ratios, which are at the lower \n end of the higher ratios recited above for electron donor bearing catalysts. Operating in this mode introduces other Specific problems, Such as the need for exceptionally precise \n control of cocatalyst feed rates to avoid reaction runaway and agglomerate formation. A further disadvantage of \n “starved” activator feed is that the hydrogen response of the catalyst, i.e. the relative hydrogen:ethylene mole ratio \n required to achieve a given molecular weight at otherwise \n constant reaction conditions, is dramatically effected requir ing larger amounts of hydrogen to achieve the same given \n molecular weight or melt index. \n Although good polymerization activity is achievable by \n adding external activator compound, the fact that catalyst \n and activator compound are added Separately requires exces \n Sive amounts of activator compound to keep the required \n amount of activator compound at the desired level at the active polymerization site. ExceSS activator compound also \n can cause formation of oils, can over-activate Some Sites \n thus forming highly branched materials which are \n undesirable, and can, in the extreme, actually cause catalyst activity decreases.

The invention lies in an improvement to this process comprising \n (A) mixing the precursor and the activator prior to intro \n duction into the reactor in two or three Steps, the last Step being a topping-off Step in which activation is completed; \n (B) maintaining the mixture from Step (A) in Slurry form; \n and \n (C) introducing the mixture from Step (B) into the reactor with the following provisos: \n (I) the atomic ratio of aluminum to titanium is in the range of about 1:1 to about 15:1 and the mole ratio \n of activator to electron donor is about 1:1 to about \n 2:1; (II) the activator is one compound or a sequential \n mixture of two different compounds, (III) each activator compound has the formula Al(R) Xs wherein each R is independently a saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon radical having 1 to 14 carbon \n atoms, each X is independently chlorine, bromine, or \n iodine, and n is 1 to 3, (IV) the activation of the precursor is essentially com pleted prior to the introduction of the precursor into \n the reactor; and \n (V) no additional activator is introduced into the reactor (S). \n DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED \n EMBODIMENT(S) \n The gaseous materials used in the process can be intro \n duced into the reactors via a recycle gas. The recycle gas is defined as a mixture of gases including ethylene per Se or ethylene and one or more alpha-olefins, preferably one or \n two alpha-olefins, as comonomers and, optionally, one or more inert gases Such as nitrogen (to make up the desired reactor pressure), inert hydrocarbons, and hydrogen. The alpha-olefins can be, for example, propylene, 1-butene, \n 1-hexene, 4-methyl-1-pentene, and 1-octene. The alpha \n olefins usually have no more than 12 carbon atoms, and preferably, 3 to 8 carbon atoms. The recycle gas can also be \n referred to as the inlet gas or cycle gas. \n The catalyst system can be exemplified by one where the \n precursor is formed by Spray drying and used in Slurry form. \n Such a catalyst precursor, for example, contains titanium, \n magnesium, and an electron donor, and, optionally, an \n aluminum halide. The precursor is introduced into a hydro \n carbon medium Such as mineral oil to provide a slurry. This \n spray dried catalyst is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,290,745. \n Other processes are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,601,742 and 4,482,687. In whichever manner the catalyst precursor is produced, the precursor is preferably Suspended in an 15 \n 25 \n 35 \n 40 \n 45 \n 50 \n 55 \n 60 \n 65 4 \n inert, high Viscosity fluid, e.g., a moderately high Viscosity \n mineral oil, to allow efficient blending of the activator compound. \n A typical magnesium/titanium based catalyst System can \n be described as follows: \n The precursor can have the formula MgTiOR).X(ED), wherein R is an aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon radical \n having 1 to 14 carbon atoms or COR' wherein R' is an aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon radical having 1 to 14 \n carbon atoms; each OR group is the same or different; X is independently chlorine, bromine or iodine, ED is an electron \n donor; d is 0.5 to 56; e is 0, 1, or 2; f is 2 to 116; and g is 1.5d+2. It is prepared from a titanium compound, a magne \n Sium compound, and an electron donor. Titanium compounds, which are useful in preparing these precursors, \n have the formula Ti(OR), X, wherein R, X, and e are as defined above, h is an integer from 1 to 4, and e--h is 3 or 4. Some specific examples of titanium compounds are TiCl, \n TiCl, Ti(OCH) Br; Ti(OCH)Cl; and Ti(OCOCH) Cls. TiCl and TiCl, are preferred compounds. The magne sium compounds include magnesium halides Such as MgCl, MgBr, and Mg2. Anhydrous MgCl2 is a preferred com \n pound. About 0.5 to about 56, and preferably about 1 to about 10, moles of the magnesium compounds are used per \n mole of titanium compound. \n The electron donor is an organic Lewis base, liquid at temperatures in the range of about 0 degrees C. to about 200 \n degrees C., in which the magnesium and titanium com \n pounds are Soluble. The electron donor can be an alkyl ester of an aliphatic or aromatic carboxylic acid, an aliphatic \n ketone, an aliphatic amine, an aliphatic alcohol, an alkyl or \n cycloalkyl ether, or mixtures thereof, each electron donor \n having 2 to 20 carbon atoms. Among these electron donors, the preferred are alkyl and cycloalkyl ethers having 2 to 20 \n carbon atoms, dialkyl, diaryl, and alkylaryl ketones having \n 3 to 20 carbon atoms, and alkyl, alkoxy, and alkylalkoxy esters of alkyl and aryl carboxylic acids having 2 to 20 \n carbon atoms. The most preferred electron donor is tetrahy \n drofuran. Other examples of Suitable electron donors are methyl formate, ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, ethyl ether, \n dioxane, di-n-propyl ether, dibutyl ether, ethanol, 1-butanol, ethyl formate, methyl acetate, ethyl anisate, ethylene \n carbonate, tetrahydropyran, and ethyl propionate. Alcohol \n containing electron donors which react with the transition metal halide compounds are not preferred. \n While an excess of electron donor is used initially to provide the reaction product of titanium compound and \n electron donor, the reaction product finally contains about 1 \n to about 20 moles of electron donor per mole of titanium compound and preferably about 1 to about 10 moles of \n electron donor per mole of titanium compound. \n The activators that can be used in the invention are \n compounds of the formula RAIX. Compounds of the \n formula RBX, (where n is 0 to 2) are typical Lewis acids, which are not activator compounds, but are useful in the \n instant invention. The activator/Lewis acid compounds are added preferably in the same inert diluent as the catalyst precursor. The precursor activator used in the pre-activation \n can be one compound or a mixture of two different com pounds. Each compound can have the formula (R)AIX, wherein each R is independently a Saturated aliphatic hydro \n carbon radical having 1 to 14 carbon atoms; each X is a halogen, preferably independently chlorine, bromine, or \n iodine, and n is 1 to 3. Examples of the R radical are methyl, ethyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, n-hexyl and n-octyl. Preferred acti \n vators include diethyl aluminum chloride, triethyl ",

Particularly preferred \n activators are: a Sequential mixture of tri-n-hexylaluminum \n and diethylaluminum chloride; a Sequential mixture of tri ethylaluminum and diethylaluminum chloride; a Sequential \n mixture of diethylaluminum chloride and tri-n- heXylaluminum; a Sequential mixture of diethylaluminum \n chloride and triethylaluminum; and either diethyl aluminum \n chloride or tri-n-hexyl aluminum. \n In the Sequential mixture, it is preferred to have the first \n precursor activator (Activator 1) of the formula AlR and the Second precursor activator (Activator 2) of formula Al(R) \n Xs, wherein R, X, and n are the same as above. Preferred mole ratioS of Activator 2 to Activator 1 range from about \n 1:1 to about 6:1. \n The activators can also be represented by the formulas RA1 or RAIX wherein each R is independently alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, or hydrogen; at least one R is hydrocarbyl, \n and two or three R radicals can be joined to form a heterocyclic structure. Each R, which is a hydrocarbyl \n radical, can have 1 to 20 carbon atoms, and preferably has 1 to 10 carbon atoms. X is a halogen, preferably chlorine, \n bromine, or iodine. \n Examples of hydrocarbyl aluminum activators, in addi \n tion to those mentioned above, are as follows: tri isobutylaluminum, di-isobutyl-aluminum hydride, dihexyla \n luminum hydride, di-isobutyl-hexylaluminum, isobutyl diheXylaluminum, trimethylaluminum, tripropylaluminum, \n trii Sopropylaluminum, tri-n-butyl aluminum, tridecylaluminum, tridodecylaluminum, tribenzylaluminum, \n trip he nylaluminum, trinaphthylaluminum, tritolylaluminum, isoprenylaluminum, dibutylaluminum \n chloride, diisobutylaluminum chloride, and ethylaluminum SeSquichloride. \n Essentially complete activation of the precursor is carried \n out prior to the introduction of the precursor into the reactor. Depending on Specific chemical equilibria, the total amount \n of activator can range from about 1 mole of activator per \n mole of electron donor to about 2 moles of activator per mole of electron donor. This ratio also applies to each \n activator when two activators are used, but the total amount \n of activator(s) will not be in excess of this ratio. It will be \n understood that after this activation, no additional activators \n are added to the reactor(s). \n In a preferred mode (Sometimes referred to as an in-line reduction System), the precursor is introduced into a hydro \n carbon Solvent slurry feed tank; the Slurry then passes to a \n Static mixer immediately downstream of an activator injec \n tion port where the slurry is mixed with the activator; then the mixture passes to a Second Static mixer immediately \n downstream of a Second activator injection port where it is \n mixed with the Second activator. The Second activator is \n optional, but preferred. The mixture then passes to another \n mixer, preferably of the same kind, where it is topped-off \n with a Small amount of activator Sufficient to complete \n activation of the precursor, i.e., an amount Sufficient to alkylate the active site and promote polymerization. A Small \n additional amount may also be included to counteract impu rities found in the polymerization System; however, this \n amount is inclusive in the overall Al:Ti atomic ratio, i.e., \n about 1:1 to about 15:1, preferably about 1:1 to about 10:1, \n and is not in excess of that ratio. \n The static mixer element is preferably mounted vertically \n to prevent Solids accumulation in the mixer. It makes no \n difference which direction the flow is going, however. A 32 \n element Static mixer in 72 inch tube size is highly efficacious. 15 \n 25 \n 35 \n 40 \n 45 \n 50 \n 55 \n 60 \n 65 6 \n The 32 element mixer (overall length is 24.75 inch) will have a relatively low pressure drop while Still providing \n intimate mixing of the fluid elements. The Static mixer element is preferably located downstream of the injection point of alkyl reducing agent to the precursor Slurry. There \n is no requirement that the mixer element be within a certain minimum distance of the mix point; however, any distance from a few inches to a few feet may be acceptable depending \n on the overall System layout and dimensions. The Static mixer element may be jacketed or not. In any case, the \n System should, at a minimum, be insulated to prevent heat loSS to the environment. Acceptable mixing can be provided \n by a 2 foot (32 element) Kenics TM static mixer. This low energy mixer functions by constantly dividing the flow and \n reversing flow directions in a circular pattern in the direction \n of the flow in the tube associated with the mixer. Depending on the activator used, Some reaction time may be required \n for the reaction of the activator with the catalyst precursor. \n This is conveniently done using a residence time Zone, \n which can consist either of an additional length of slurry feed pipe or an essentially plug flow holding vessel. A \n residence time Zone can be used for both activators, for only one or for neither, depending entirely on the rate of reaction between activator and catalyst precursor. See discussion of \n residence time pots below. The entire mixture, after the topping-off Step, is then introduced into the reactor, usually \n at the same time as the flow of ethylene is initiated. \n It is noted that due to the high viscosity of the slurry, heat transfer is relatively poor (the Reynolds number is in the 1 to 10 range). Degradation can begin to occur at temperatures \n higher than 60 degrees C. Thus, activation is normally \n effected at temperatures in the range of about 10 to about 60 degrees C., preferably about 30 to about 45 degrees C. In any \n case, good mixing is needed to maintain constant tempera \n tures and allow for completion of the reaction in view of the prevalent low mass transfer coefficients in high Viscosity Systems. Intense high energy input mixing, mixing by injec \n tion into a flowing Stream, and mixing by diffusion are not \n recommended. \n To assure a uniform final catalyst precursor, it is important \n that the flow through the mixing devices be as close to plug \n flow as possible. In addition, Some of the reactions require \n finite amounts of time to proceed to completion So it is also necessary to provide residence time in the System. Although \n this can be accomplished by use of long loops of pipe or tubing, the risk of catalyst precursor Settling out during \n unavoidable outages in catalyst feed and the high preSSure \n drop that this will cause makes this highly impractical. \n Instead, the process of the invention is preferably carried out utilizing residence time pots designed to promote plug flow while retaining the catalyst Slurry in Suspension. \n The design of the residence time pot is such that it will promote uniform (or close to uniform) residence times as well as constant temperature. Since plug flow is desired, designs which promote back mixing are definitely not pre \n ferred. Although Some back mixing will naturally occur in tubing lines (due to Velocity gradients-a natural consequence of being totally in laminar flow), this is of relatively minor \n impact. Axial mixing in the residence time pots is minimized by maintaining a high aspect ratio a preferred L/D (length \n to diameter ratio) of about 10 to about 15). This results in a low velocity in the residence time pot and minimal back mixing due to Velocity gradients in laminar flow. \n Some homogenization of the slurry occurs at the transi \n tion Section from the residence time pot to the Smaller diameter feed lines. Additional radial mixing is preferably \n provided by Small impellers, which are located near the ",

The impeller promotes Some radial mixing, but mainly assures that the bottom Section of the residence time pot does not experience SuS pended solid buildup. \n After activator has been added to the catalyst precursor Slurry in one or two steps, additional activator is added as a last step prior to entry into the reactor. Preferably, this \n addition occurs within 30 minutes and preferably within less than 15 minutes of actual injection of the catalyst precursor \n Slurry into the reactor. The activator can be in Solution in an inert Solvent (Such as a high Viscosity fluid carrier or a lower Viscosity Solvent) or added as pure component. It is essential \n that a mixer, preferably an additional Static mixer element, be located immediately downstream of the addition point of \n the additional activator. It is also important to keep the Slurry flowing to assure that no plugs form in the catalyst feed line. \n Additional activator is fed to provide for sufficient activation of the catalyst plus a Small additional amount to Scavenge \n impurities in the polymerization reactor. The total amount of \n this additional “topping off activator can be about 0.1 to \n about 75 percent by mol of the total amount of the activator \n used for the activation of the precursor. Addition of all of the activator to the catalyst precursor eliminates mass transfer problems, which would prevent the activator from reaching the catalyst precursor if Separate addition to the reactor was \n practiced. This practice leads to extremely efficient utiliza tion of activator and improved polymer product properties. \n After completion of the mixing of activator with catalyst \n precursor, direct injection into the reactor occurs. Means of feeding a slurry to a gas phase reactor are well known and described in the art (see European Patent Application 635 521, for example). \n The hydrocarbon used for the formation of the slurry can \n be any essentially air and moisture free aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon which is unreactive with the catalyst precursor, \n the precursor activator compounds, and the cocatalyst. In \n practice, Since many of the final polymer products find end \n uses in food packaging, aromatic hydrocarbons would not be a preferred slurry solvent. The hydrocarbon slurry solvent is \n typically chosen from hydrogenated “mineral oils” or naph \n thenic oils of relatively high Viscosity to minimize Settling of \n catalyst Solids in feed tubes and the like, although, with appropriate engineering design, lower Viscosity Solvents \n Such as isopentane, hexane, and heptane can be used as Slurry Solvents. These are not particularly preferred due to \n the additional complexity introduced by use of a lower Viscosity and more easily Settled slurry as catalyst. The \n viscosity of the hydrocarbon slurry solvent, however, is sufficiently low so that the slurry can be conveniently pumped through the pre-activation apparatus and eventually \n into the polymerization reactor. Preferred Solvents are ali phatic hydrocarbons with viscosity greater than about 50 centipoises (cps), particularly greater than about 100 cps and \n less than about 5,000 cps. Particularly preferred solvents are \n napthenic mineral oils typified by materials Such as the Kaydol series of food grade mineral oils supplied by Witco \n under the trademark Kaydol(R) 350 and 550. \n It is preferred not to use a Support. However, in those \n cases where it is desired to Support the precursor, Silica is the preferred Support. Other Suitable Supports are inorganic \n oxides Such as aluminum phosphate, alumina, Silica/alumina mixtures, Silica modified with an organoaluminum com pound Such as triethylaluminum, and Silica modified with diethyl Zinc. A typical Support is a Solid, particulate, porous \n material essentially inert to the polymerization. It is used as a dry powder having an average particle Size of about 10 to \n about 250 microns and preferably about 30 to about 100 15 \n 25 \n 35 \n 40 \n 45 \n 50 \n 55 \n 60 \n 65 8 \n microns, a Surface area of at least 200 Square meters per gram and preferably at least about 250 Square meters per \n gram; and a pore Size of at least about 100 angstroms and preferably at least about 200 angstroms. Generally, the \n amount of support used is that which will provide about 0.1 \n to about 1.0 millimole of titanium per gram of Support and \n preferably about 0.4 to about 0.9 millimole of titanium per gram of Support. Impregnation of the above mentioned catalyst precursor into a Silica Support can be accomplished \n by mixing the precursor and Silica gel in the electron donor \n solvent or other solvent followed by solvent removal under reduced pressure. The resultant Solid catalyst is then con verted into a free flowing Slurry with an aliphatic hydrocar \n bon as described above Such that it is pumpable as a liquid into the process. Catalyst precursorS Such as those described \n in U.S. Pat. No. 5,290,745 and European Patent Application 771 820 are particularly useful in the process of subject \n invention when placed into a hydrocarbon Slurry in the \n unactivated State. \n The polymerization is conducted in the gas phase using a \n continuous fluidized bed process. \n Melt index is determined under ASTM D-1238, Condition E. It is measured at 190° C. and 2.16 kilograms and reported as grams per 10 minutes or decigrams per minute. Flow \n index is determined under ASTM D-1238, Condition F. It is \n measured at 190° C. and 10 times the weight used in determining the melt index, and reported as grams per 10 \n minutes or decigrams per minute. Melt flow ratio is the ratio \n of flow index to melt index. The product, as removed from \n the reactor, can have a melt indeX in the range of about 0.02 to about 300 grams per 10 minutes, and preferably has a melt \n index in the range of about >0.04 to about 50 grams per 10 \n minutes. The melt flow ratio is in the range of about 20 to about 50, and is preferably in the range of about 20 to about 30. The density of the polymer is normally at least 0.900 \n gram per cubic centimeter, and is preferably in the range of \n 0.915 to 0.960 gram per cubic centimeter. The bulk density \n can be in the range of about 18 to about 32 pounds per cubic foot, and is preferably greater than 22 pounds per cubic foot. \n The molecular weight distribution of the polymer is reflected \n in an Mw/Mn of about 3 to about 7. Mw is the weight average molecular weight, Mn is the number average \n molecular weight; and the Mw/Mn ratio can be referred to as the polydispersity index, which is a measure of the \n breadth of the molecular weight distribution. Mw/Mn can \n also be related to MFR, with lower values of MFR indicated \n lower values of Mw/Mn and a narrower molecular weight \n distribution. \n The transition metal based catalyst System including the activated precursor, ethylene, and, optionally, alpha-olefin \n and hydrogen are continuously fed into the reactor, and the \n final product is continuously removed from the reactor. \n In the reactor: \n The mole ratio of alpha-olefin (if used) to ethylene can be in the range of about 0.01:1 to about 0.8:1, and is preferably \n in the range of about 0.02:1 to about 0.35:1. The mole ratio of hydrogen (if used) to ethylene can be in the range of about \n 0.001:1 to about 2:1, and is preferably in the range of about 0.01 to about 0.5:1. Preferred operating temperatures vary \n depending on the density desired, i.e., lower temperatures \n for lower densities and higher temperatures for higher \n densities. \n The pressure, i.e., the total pressure in the reactor, can be in the range of about 200 to about 500 psig (pounds per Square inch gauge) and is preferably in the range of about \n 280 to about 450 psig.

The balance of the total pressure is provided by alpha-olefin (if used) and an \n inert gas Such as nitrogen. Other inert hydrocarbons, Such as an induced condensing agent e.g., isopentane, hexane also \n contribute to the overall preSSure in the reactor according to their vapor pressure under the temperature and pressure \n experienced in the reactor. A typical fluidized bed reactor \n can be described as follows: \n The bed is usually made up of the same granular resin that \n is to be produced in the reactor. Thus, during the course of the polymerization, the bed comprises formed polymer particles, growing polymer particles, and catalyst particles \n fluidized by polymerization and modifying gaseous compo \n nents introduced at a flow rate or Velocity Sufficient to cause the particles to Separate and act as a fluid. The fluidizing gas \n is made up of the initial feed, make-up feed, and cycle \n (recycle) gas, i.e., comonomers and, if desired, modifiers and/or an inert carrier gas. \n The essential parts of the reaction System are the vessel, \n the bed, the gas distribution plate, inlet and outlet piping, a compressor, cycle gas cooler, and a product discharge SyS \n tem. In the vessel, above the bed, there is a velocity \n reduction Zone, and, in the bed, a reaction Zone. Both are above the gas distribution plate. \n A typical fluidized bed reactor is further described in U.S. \n Pat. No. 4,482,687. \n The gaseous feed Streams of ethylene, other gaseous alpha-olefins (if used), and hydrogen (if used) are preferably fed to the reactor recycle line as well as liquid alpha-olefins (if used). The activated catalyst precursor is preferably \n injected into the fluidized bed as a Solid or a mineral oil Slurry. The product composition can be varied by changing \n the molar ratioS of the comonomers introduced into the \n fluidized bed. The product is continuously discharged in \n granular or particulate form from the reactor as the bed level builds up with polymerization. The production rate is con \n trolled by adjusting the catalyst feed rate and/or the ethylene partial pressures. \n The hydrogen:ethylene mole ratio can be adjusted to control average molecular weights. The alpha-olefins (other than ethylene) can be present in a total amount of up to 15 percent by weight of the copolymer and, if used, are pref \n erably included in the copolymer in a total amount of about 1 to about 10 percent by weight based on the weight of the copolymer. \n The residence time of the mixture of reactants including gaseous and liquid reactants, catalyst, and resin in the \n fluidized bed can be in the range of about 1 to about 12 hours and is preferably in the range of about 2 to about 5 hours. \n The reactor can be run in the condensing mode, if desired. \n The condensing mode is described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,543, \n 399; 4,588,790; and 5,352,749. \n The resin can be extruded in a conventional extruder \n adapted for that purpose. Extruders and processes for extru \n Sion are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,814, 135; 4,857,600; \n 5,076,988; and 5,153,382. Examples of various extruders, which can be used in forming film are a single Screw type \n Such as one modified with a blown film die and air ring and continuous take off equipment, a blown film extruder, and a Slot cast extruder. A typical Single Screw type extruder can be described as one having a hopper at its upstream end and \n a die at its downstream end. The hopper feeds into a barrel, \n which contains a Screw. At the downstream end, between the \n end of the Screw and the die, is a Screen pack and a breaker plate. The screw portion of the extruder is considered to be 15 \n 25 \n 35 \n 40 \n 45 \n 50 \n 55 \n 60 \n 65 10 \n divided up into three Sections, the feed Section, the com pression Section, and the metering Section, and multiple \n heating Zones from the rear heating Zone to the front heating \n Zone, the multiple Sections and Zones running from upstream \n to downstream. If it has more than one barrel, the barrels are \n connected in Series. The length to diameter ratio of each barrel is in the range of about 16:1 to about 30:1. The extrusion can take place at temperatures in the range of \n about 160 to about 270 degrees C., and is preferably carried \n out at temperatures in the range of about 180 to about 240 degrees C. \n The advantages of the invention are found in that molecu \n lar weight distribution can be narrowed and hexane extract \n ables can be decreased without a decrease in hydrogen response and catalyst activity; there is no rapid increase in \n reaction rate, which can result in sheeting, chunking, and cessation of operation; reduction of the cocatalyst, i.e., activator, requirement; improved proceSS control; the pre \n cursor is leSS Sensitive to over-reduction; catalyst fines are all active So they are less likely to Segregate and migrate to \n the reactor wall to form sheets, facilitates activator change where different products are desired; the process allows for \n complete activation even where the activator has very low (or nil) vapor pressure Such as tri-n-hexyl aluminum; the \n process allows the use of leSS expensive activatorS Such as triethylaluminum and triusobutylaluminum; eliminates the \n need for Separate cocatalyst feed; although the proceSS is \n primarily focused on higher molecular weight (and lower levels of low molecular weight species), narrow molecular weight distribution products for fabrication into film, the process has broader application to higher melt indeX products, typically resins used in injection molding, elimi \n nates other forms of catalyst premixing, often a unit opera tion; and allows for quick changes of catalyst by changing \n relative flow rates of precursor and activator. \n Conventional additives, which can be introduced into the resin product, are exemplified by antioxidants, ultraViolet absorbers, pigments, dyes, nucleating agents, fillers, Slip \n agents, fire retardants, plasticizers, processing aids, \n lubricants, Stabilizers, Smoke inhibitors, Viscosity control agents, and crosslinking agents, catalysts, and boosters, \n tackifiers, and anti-blocking agents. Aside from the fillers, \n the additives can be present in the blend in amounts of about 0.1 to about 10 parts by weight of additive for each 100 parts \n by weight of polymer blend.

The Smaller reaction System is used illustratively to avoid experi \n mentation in large commercial equipment, which can result in large amounts of off-specification polymer during the \n experiment. The results described below, however, are directly Scalable to large Scale commercial reaction Systems. \n Note: ratioS are mole ratioS unless otherwise Stated. \n Catalyst Precursor Preparation \n A titanium trichloride containing catalyst precursor is \n prepared in a 1900 liter vessel equipped with pressure and temperature controls and a turbine agitator. A nitrogen \n atmosphere (less than 5 ppm H2O) is maintained at all times. 1480 liters of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (THF, the internal \n electron donor) containing less than 40 ppm H2O are added to the vessel. The THF is heated to a temperature of 50 degrees C., and 1.7 kilograms of granular magnesium metal \n (70.9 gram atoms) are added, followed by 27.2 kilograms of titanium tetrachloride (137 mols). The magnesium metal has a particle size in the range of from 0.1 to 4 millimeters. The \n titanium tetrachloride is added over a period of about \n one-half hour. \n The mixture is continuously agitated. The exotherm \n resulting from the addition of titanium tetrachloride causes the temperature of the mixture to rise to approximately 72 \n degrees C. Over a period of about three hours. The tempera \n ture is held at about 70 degrees C. by heating for approxi \n mately another four hours. At the end of this time, 61.7 kilograms of magnesium dichloride (540 moles) are added and heating is continued at 70 degrees C. for another eight \n hours. The mixture (solution) is then filtered through a 100 micron filter to remove undissolved magnesium dichloride and unreacted magnesium (less than 0.5 percent by weight). \n 100 kilograms of fumed Silica having a particle Size in the \n range of from 0.1 to 1 microns are added to the mixture prepared above over a period of about two hours. The \n mixture is stirred by means of a turbine agitator during this \n time and for Several hours thereafter to thoroughly disperse \n the Silica in the Solution. The temperature of the mixture is held at 70 degrees C. throughout this period and a nitrogen \n atmosphere is maintained at all times. \n The resulting Slurry is spray dried using an 8-foot diam \n eter closed cycle spray dryer equipped with a rotary atom izer. The rotary atomizer is adjusted to give catalyst particles \n with a D50 of 18 microns. The scrubber section of the spray dryer is maintained at approximately minus 4 degrees C. \n Nitrogen gas is introduced into the Spray dryer at an inlet \n temperature of 165 degrees C. and is circulated at a rate of approximately 1700 kilograms per hour. The catalyst Slurry \n is fed to the Spray dryer at a temperature of about 35 degrees \n C. and a rate of 90 to 95 kilograms per hour, or sufficient to yield an outlet gas temperature of approximately 125 \n degrees C. The atomization pressure is slightly above atmo Spheric. Discrete Spray dried catalyst precursor particles are \n formed. \n The Spray dried catalyst precursor contains 2.5 weight percent Ti, 6.3 weight percent Mg, and 25 to 29 weight \n percent THF. The particles have a D50 of 14 microns and a span (D90-D10)/D50 ranging from 0.75 to 1.25 as deter mined by means of a Leeds and Northrup Microtrac(R) particle size analyzer using a dodecane Solvent, The discrete \n catalyst precursor particles are mixed with mineral oil under \n a nitrogen atmosphere in a 400 liter vessel equipped with a turbine agitator to form a slurry containing approximately 28 \n weight percent of the Solid catalyst precursor. 15 \n 25 \n 35 \n 40 \n 45 \n 50 \n 55 \n 60 \n 65 12 \n To partially activate the catalyst Slurry, a 50 weight \n percent solution of tri-n-hexylaluminum (TnHAI) in mineral \n oil is added to the slurry followed by mixing for approxi \n mately 72 hour. The TnHAI solution is employed in an \n amount sufficient to provide 0.20 mole of TnHAI per mole of THF in the catalyst. Sequentially, then a 30 weight \n percent solution of diethylaluminum chloride (DEAC) in \n mineral oil is added and the mixture is mixed and held for \n approximately 1 hour. The DEAC is employed in an amount \n sufficient to provide 0.45 mole of DEAC per mole of THF \n in the catalyst. The mole ratio of total activator (TnHAI plus \n DEAC) to THF is 0.65:1. \n Ethylene is copolymerized with 1-butene in a fluidized \n bed reactor as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,349,648. Each polymerization is continuously conducted after equilibrium \n is reached under conditions set forth in Table I. Polymer \n ization is initiated in the reactor by continuously feeding the \n above preactivated catalyst precursor into a fluidized bed of \n polyethylene granules together with ethylene, 1-hexene, and \n hydrogen. In example 1, an activator (in this case, a \n cocatalyst) is dissolved in isopentane (iC5) and fed to reactor Separately from the preactivated catalyst. \n Example 1 is repeated in examples 2 to 4 with the \n exception that the activator is now admixed with the catalyst \n in a final Step prior to addition to the reactor. Preactivated \n catalyst and triethylaluminum activator are mixed in-line for \n approximately 1 to 1.5 minutes. No external activator is fed \n to the reactor. The reaction conditions are set forth in Table \n I. The MFR and the bulk density are shown in Table II. It \n will be noted that the MFR and bulk density of the blend \n change with changes in the total activator/electron donor \n mole ratio with little change in other polymer properties or \n reaction conditions. Although the change in MFR is Small, \n changes of this kind can have significant effects on end use \n properties as indicated in U.S. Pat. No. 4,349,648, men \n tioned above. The change in Settled bulk density is greater with the highest bulk density (example 4) occurring at the \n lowest total activator/electron donor mole ratio. \n TABLE I \n Example \n REACTION 1. \n CONDITIONS Control 2 3 4 \n Temperature ( C.) 88 88 88 88 \n Pressure (psia) 350 350 350 350 \n Comonomer Type 1-butene 1-butene 1-butene 1-buteme \n C2 Partial Pressure 90 90 90 90 (psia) \n H2/C2 Mole Ratio O.130 O.125 O.125 O.18O \n C4/C2 Mole Ratio 340 340 350 360 \n Recycle iC5 Mole % 6.O 5.8 5.6 5.5 \n Cocatalyst Type TEAL TEAL TEAL TEAL \n Drum Avg.

Catalyst is prepared as in Example 1. The Same reaction \n System is used. In these examples, however, 1-hexene is used as comonomer and trimethylaluminum as activator. In the control (example 5), the activator (cocatalyst) is fed Separately to the fluidized bed as a Solution in isopentane. 15 14 \n U.S. Pat. No. 5,068,489 is used in Comparative Examples 1, \n 3, 5, and 6. In the examples using a Silica impregnated \n catalyst, the catalyst is introduced to the reactor as a dry \n powder. In Comparative Examples 2, 4, 7, and 8, the catalyst \n is fed to the reactor as a slurry. In these examples, the \n activator (cocatalyst) is fed separately to the polymerizing \n bed. The spray dried slurry fed catalyst of Comparative \n Examples 2, 4, 7, and 8 is normally of higher productivity \n and hence lower residual titanium level than the Silica \n impregnated catalyst. This is illustrated by comparing Com \n parative Examples 1 and 2. Note, that despite Similar reac \n tion conditions, much higher residual titanium levels are \n observed at these low activator:Timolar ratios, even though \n the activator:ED molar ratios are much higher than those in Examples 1 to 9 illustrating the invention; also note the \n substantially lower residual titanium for the catalysts of the \n invention. Thus, a much more efficacious use of cocatalyst \n activator is achieved by the process of the invention, as well \n 0 as achieving the same results in terms of reduced MFR i.e., \n narrower molecular weight distribution (MWD) and lower hexane extractables. Both catalyst productivity and activa \n tor utilization effectiveneSS are improved through addition of \n the activator directly with the activated catalyst precursor composition in a hydrocarbon slurry. \n TABLE III \n Example \n REACTION 5 \n CONDITIONS Control 6 7 8 9 \n Temperature (C.) 88 88 88 88 88 \n Pressure (Psia) 350 350 350 350 350 \n Comonomer Type Hexene Hexene Hexene Hexene Hexene \n C2 Partial Pressure (Psia) 90 90 90 90 90 \n H2/C2 Mole Ratio O.12O O.120 O.130 O.130 O140 \n C6/C2 Mole Ratio O.1OO O.1OO O.1OO O.1OO O.1OO \n Recycle iC5 Mole % 6.O 5.9 6.O 6.O 6.O \n Cocatalyst Type TMA TMA TMA TMA TMA \n Drum Avg.

This low pressure proceSS provides a broad range of LLDPE products for blown and cast film, injection molding, rotational molding, blow molding, pipe, tubing, and wire and cable applications. LLDPE has essentially a linear \n backbone with only short chain branches, about 2 to 6 carbon atoms in length. In LLDPE, the length and frequency of branching, and, consequently, the density, is controlled by \n the type and amount of comonomer used in the polymer ization. Although the majority of the LLDPE resins on the market today have a narrow molecular weight distribution, LLDPE resins with a broad molecular weight distribution are available for a number of non-film applications. LLDPE resins designed for commodity type applications \n typically incorporate 1-butene as the comonomer. The use of a higher molecular weight alpha-olefin comonomer pro duces resins with Significant Strength advantages relative to those of ethylene/1-butene copolymers. The predominant \n higher alpha-olefin comonomers in commercial use are 1-hexene, 4-methyl-1-pentene, and 1-octene. The bulk of the LLDPE is used in film products where the excellent physical properties and drawdown characteristics of LLDPE film makes this film well Suited for a broad Spectrum of appli cations. Fabrication of LLDPE film is generally effected by the blown film and Slot casting processes. The resulting film is characterized by excellent tensile Strength, high ultimate elongation, good impact Strength, and excellent puncture \n resistance. \n These properties together with toughneSS are enhanced when the polyethylene is of high molecular weight. However, as the molecular weight of the polyethylene increases, the processability of the resin usually decreases. By providing a blend of polymers, the properties character \n istic of high molecular weight resins can be retained and processability, particularly the extrudability (from the lower molecular weight component) can be improved. \n The blending of these polymerS is Successfully achieved \n in a Staged reactor proceSS Similar to those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,047,468 and 5,149,738. Briefly, the process is one for the in Situ blending of polymers wherein a higher density ethylene copolymer is prepared in a high melt indeX reactor and a lower density ethylene copolymer is prepared \n in a low melt indeX reactor. The process typically comprises continuously contacting, under polymerization conditions, a \n mixture of ethylene and one or more alpha-olefins with a catalyst System in two gas phase, fluidized bed reactors connected in Series, said catalyst System comprising: (i) a Supported magnesium/titanium based catalyst precursor; (ii) an aluminum containing activator compound; and (iii) a hydrocarbyl aluminum cocatalyst, the polymerization con ditions being Such that an ethylene copolymer having a melt \n index in the range of about 0.1 to about 1000 grams per 10 \n minutes is formed in the high melt indeX reactor and an ethylene copolymer having a melt indeX in the range of \n about 0.001 to about 1 gram per 10 minutes is formed in the low melt indeX reactor, each copolymer having a density of \n about 0.860 to about 0.965 gram per cubic centimeter and a melt flow ratio in the range of about 22 to about 70, with the provisoS that: 1O \n 15 \n 25 \n 35 \n 40 \n 45 \n 50 \n 55 \n 60 \n 65 2 \n (a) the mixture of ethylene copolymer matrix and active \n catalyst formed in the first reactor in the Series is \n transferred to the Second reactor in the Series, \n (b) other than the active catalyst referred to in proviso (a) and the cocatalyst referred to in proviso (e), no addi \n tional catalyst is introduced into the Second reactor; \n (c) in the high melt index reactor: (1) the alpha-olefin is present in a ratio of about 0.02 to about 3.5 moles of alpha-olefin per mole of ethylene; \n and \n (2) hydrogen is present in a ratio of about 0.05 to about 3 moles of hydrogen per mole of combined ethylene and alpha-olefin; \n (d) in the low melt index reactor: (1) the alpha-olefin is present in a ratio of about 0.02 to about 3.5 moles of alpha-olefin per mole of ethylene; \n and \n (2) hydrogen is, optionally, present in a ratio of about \n 0.0001 to about 0.5 mole of hydrogen per mole of combined ethylene and alpha-olefin; and \n (e) additional hydrocarbyl aluminum cocatalyst is intro \n duced into the Second reactor in an amount Sufficient to \n restore the level of activity of the catalyst transferred \n from the first reactor to about the initial level of activity \n in the first reactor. \n While the in situ blends prepared as above and the films produced therefrom are found to have the advantageous \n characteristics heretofore mentioned, the commercial appli cation of these granular bimodal polymerS is limited by unacceptable levels of gels in contrast to competitive bimo dal resins produced from Slurry or Solution processes. Par \n ticle size distribution and flow characteristics Studies indi \n cate that the gas phase resins having an average particle size (APS) of about 400 to about 600 microns exhibit significant compositional, molecular, and rheological heterogeneities. When Such a granular resin is compounded, for example, \n with a conventional twin Screw mixer in a single pass, and the resulting pellets are fabricated into film, the film exhibits a high level of gels ranging in size from less than about 100 microns to greater than about 500 microns. These gels adversely effect the aesthetic appearance of the product. The gel characteristics of a film product are usually designated by a subjective scale of Film Appearance Rating (FAR) varying from minus 50 (very poor; these films have a large number of large gels) to plus 50 (very good; these films have a Small amount of, or essentially no, gels). The FAR of the Single pass film product mentioned above is generally in the \n range of about minus 50 to about minus 10/0. For commer cial acceptability, the FAR should be plus 20 or better. Several patents have Successfully addressed the gel prob \n lem. One such patent is U.S. Pat. No. 5,405,901. Unfortunately, this patent, for example, Suffers from other \n deficiencies. The extrusion line Speed of the product resin, which is a measure of bubble strength and stability, is found to be in the neighborhood of 90 feet per minute, and the dart drop Strength, while high for one mil film, is not achievable \n on 0.5 mil film due to low bubble stability. Meanwhile, in the realm of high and medium density, high molecular weight film applications, industry is Seeking resins with minimum \n extrusion line Speeds of about 210 feet per minute and thus films with higher bubble strength and stability together with higher dart drop Strength in the narrower gauges. \n DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION \n An object of this invention, therefore, is to provide a process for preparing an in Situ blend, which, can be extruded into a film at high line Speeds, the film having the bubble strength and stability, which translates into high ",

It \n will be understood by those skilled in the art that the transfer is effected without exposing the mixture to the atmosphere. \n The copolymers produced in each of the reactors are copolymers of ethylene and at least one alpha-olefin \n comonomer having 3 to 8 carbon atoms, preferably one or two alpha-olefin comonomers. The alpha-olefins can be, for example, propylene, 1-butene, 1-hexene, 4-methyl-1- \n pentene, and 1-octene. 15 \n 25 \n 35 \n 40 \n 45 \n 50 \n 55 \n 60 \n 65 4 \n Preferred comonomer combinations: \n first reactor second reactor \n 1-hexene 1-hexene \n 1-butene 1-hexene \n 1-butene 1-butene \n 1-hexene 1-butene \n The 1-hexene/1-hexene combination is found to give the best film properties; however, the 1-hexene/1-butene com bination is found to provide acceptable properties while Still meeting FDA Specifications since a terpolymer increases the \n FDA allowable comonomer content, e.g., for a 1-hexene copolymer, the maximum allowable comonomer content is 10 percent by weight whereas for a 1-hexene/1-butene terpolymer, the maximum allowable comonomer content is 15 percent by weight. For FDA purposes, the 1-hexene/1- \n hexene combination is considered a copolymer and the 1-hexene/1-butene combination is considered a terpolymer. \n It will be understood that the in situ blend can be \n characterized as a bimodal resin. The properties of bimodal resins are Strongly dependent on the proportion of the high \n molecular weight component, i.e., the low melt indeX com ponent. For a Staged reactor System, the proportion of the high molecular weight component is controlled via the relative production rate in each reactor. The relative produc \n tion rate in each reactor can, in turn, be controlled by a computer application program, which monitors the produc \n tion rate in the reactors (measured by heat balance) and then manipulates the ethylene partial preSSure in each reactor and \n catalyst feed rate in order to meet the production rate, the production rate Split, and catalyst productivity requirements. \n It will be further understood that there may be a second alpha-olefin comonomer in each reactor coming from a vent recovery System, for example. In this case, recovered liquids \n containing both comonomers are fed into the first reactor and there is carryover from the first reactor to the Second reactor due to the Solubility of the comonomer in the resin. This could account for a terpolymer in each reactor. The molar ratio of C6 to C4 (or other combination of higher alpha-olefin to lower alpha-olefin) is preferably no less than \n about 5:1 in the first reactor. Any molar ratio is Satisfactory in the Second reactor. In any case, the overall molar ratioS of alpha-olefin to ethylene in each reactor do not change. \n High speed extrusion bubble stability is an important \n factor in blown film extrusion processes. A blown film extrusion proceSS is one in which molten polymer is forced through an annular die to form a continuous cylindrical tube. \n Outside the die, the tube is blown out to a larger diameter than the die diameter, cooled by an air ring, and then flattened before wind-up. The ratio of the final diameter of the cylindrical tube to the diameter of the annulus is called the blow-up ratio (BUR). The combination of the extrusion rate, BUR, and the speed with which the tube is drawn out determines the final film thickness. The ability to produce thinner films at higher rates of extrusion is governed by many factors including the molecular and Theological char acteristics of the molten polymer, dependence of properties on temperature, and the design of the air ring. \n The entire cylindrical tube between the die and the collapsing frame (where the tube is flattened) is called the “bubble.” This is a cylindrical bubble in contrast to tradi tionally familiar spherical bubbles in which air, or some other gas, is enveloped by a thin liquid film. Here, air is used \n to blow a thin molten polymer film. The bubble looks conical from the outside because of a change in the diameter until the solidification at the frost-line height (FLH). ",

Past the FLH, however, the shape does not change from a circular cylindrical tube of constant \n diameter. Note that between the die and the FLH the bubble \n is always Semi-molten. \n One would like to produce a final film with close tolerance in film thickneSS under Stable conditions of operation. That is, the shape of the bubble remains the same without any change over time. The highest extrusion rate and the highest wind-up speed that can be used without changing the shape of the bubble provides the operating constraints for a given resin in a given System (extruder, air ring, cooling air temperature, etc.). For example, at a given extrusion rate, if one can increase the wind-up speed to make thinner film without losing the shape of the bubble, then the resin is said to have good high Speed extrusion bubble Stability. \n Often, the bubble stability within a given extrusion sys \n tem is directly related to the molecular characteristics which influence the behavior of the bubble. For example, it is easier to Stretch chewing gum into a very thin thread without breakage than a rubber band. A rubber band stiffens as it is Stretched and, beyond a certain point, it will break. However, the stiffening of the rubber band also gives it better stability \n since it will be less sensitive to external disturbances. This \n is not the case with the chewing gum Since it deforms very \n easily and is very sensitive to disturbances. In the blown film concept, one would like to have rubber band behavior as the bubble is being blown and stretched rather than a chewing gum behavior. In this invention, the combination of a particular precursor, in Situ blending, ethylene partial \n preSSure, and other defined parameters has been found to provide better high speed extrusion bubble stability, i.e., the film can be drawn at higher wind-up speeds to produce \n thinner films. \n The magnesium/titanium based catalyst System can be \n exemplified by the catalyst system described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,122,494. This System includes a precursor, an activator, and a cocatalyst. The precursor can be Supported or unsup ported. The precursor (prior to activation) is formed by contacting a magnesium alkoxide, a titanium tetraalkoxide, and Small amount of a Solubility enhancing agent which can be a species Such as carbon dioxide, triethylborate, a bromide, or a phenolic compound Selected from the group consisting of phenol and a phenol Substituted with an alkyl, an alkoxy, a halogen, or a dialkylamino group and can be \n isolated as a solid either by removal of solvent (as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,106,806) or by precipitation as a halide complex (as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,066,737). The reaction product can be represented essentially by the for mula MgTiOOR):X wherein each R is independently an alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, preferably ethyl, and \n each X is independently a halide anion or a monovalent anion of a phenolic compound. X is preferably chloride or an anion of ortho-cresol or 2,6-di-t-butyl-4-methylphenol. The precursor is partially activated by contacting with an alkylaluminum halide. The alkylaluminum halide is an acti Vator compound and can be represented by the formula \n RATY, wherein R is an alkyl group having 1 to 8 carbon atoms, Y is a halogen Such as chlorine, bromine, or iodine, preferably chlorine; and n is 1 or 2. More detail can be found in U.S. Patent application Ser. No. 09/395,924 filed on Sep. 14, 1999, particularly examples 5 and 7. \n Preferred activators include alkylaluminum mono- and \n dichlorides wherein each alkyl radical has 1 to 6 carbon atoms. Examples of preferred activators are diethylalumi num chloride (DEAC) and ethylaluminum dichloride (EADC). Other conventional activators can also be used if desired. The molar ratio of activator to titanium can be in the 15 \n 25 \n 35 \n 40 \n 45 \n 50 \n 55 \n 60 \n 65 6 \n range of about 1:1 to about 150:1 and is preferably in the range of about 10:1 to about 30:1. The cocatalyst, generally a hydrocarbyl aluminum cocatalyst, can be represented by the formula R.Al, (RAIO), or RAIX wherein each R is independently alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, or hydrogen; at least one R is hydrocarbyl, and two or three R radicals can be joined to form a heterocyclic Structure. Each R, which is a hydrocarbyl radical, can have 1 to 20 carbon atoms, and preferably has 1 to 10 carbon atoms. X is a halogen, preferably chlorine, bromine, or iodine. Examples of hydrocarbyl aluminum compounds are as follows: triisobutylaluminum, tri-n-hexylaluminum, di-isobutyl-aluminum hydride, dihexylaluminum dihydride, di-isobutyl-hexylaluminum, isobutyl diheXylaluminum, trimethyl-aluminum, triethylaluminum, tripropylaluminum, \n trii Sopropylaluminum, tri-n-butyl aluminum, trioctylaluminum, tridecylaluminum, tridodecylaluminum, \n tribe in Zyl aluminum, trip he nylaluminum, trinaphthylaluminum, tritolylaluminum, dibutylaluminum \n chloride, diethylaluminum chloride, and ethylaluminum Ses quichloride. The cocatalyst is preferably added Separately \n neat or as a Solution in an inert Solvent, Such as isopentane, to the polymerization reactor at the Same time as the flow of ethylene is initiated. The cocatalyst compounds can also be \n used as the activators referred to above. \n As noted in U.S. Pat. No. 5,122,494, selectivity control agents can be used in the polymerization proceSS if desired, preferably when the primary olefin is propylene. \n AS noted above, the precursor can be prepared as a granular Solid or as a Solution. In those cases where it is desired to Support the Soluble precursor, Silica is the pre ferred Support. Other Suitable Supports are inorganic oxides \n Such as aluminum phosphate, alumina, Silica/alumina mixtures, Silica modified with an organoaluminum com pound Such as triethylaluminum, and Silica modified with diethyl Zinc. A typical Support is a Solid, particulate, porous \n material essentially inert to the polymerization. It is used as a dry powder having an average particle size of about 10 to \n about 250 microns and preferably about 30 to about 100 microns, a Surface area of at least 200 Square meters per gram and preferably at least about 250 Square meters per gram; and a pore Size of at least about 100 angstroms and preferably at least about 200 angstroms. Generally, the \n amount of support used is that which will provide about 0.1 to about 1.0 millimole of titanium per gram of Support and preferably about 0.4 to about 0.9 millimole of titanium per gram of Support. Impregnation of the above mentioned Soluble catalyst precursor into a Silica Support can be accom plished by mixing the precursor Solution and Silica gel in the \n electron donor solvent or other solvent followed by solvent removal under reduced preSSure. When a Support is not desired, the Soluble catalyst precursor can be used in liquid \n form. \n The entire catalyst System, which includes a partially activated precursor and the cocatalyst, is added to the first reactor. The catalyst is admixed with the copolymer pro \n duced in the first reactor, and the mixture is transferred to the Second reactor. Insofar as the catalyst is concerned, only cocatalyst is added to the Second reactor from an outside \n SOCC. \n The polymerization in each reactor is, preferably, con ducted in the gas phase using a continuous fluidized process. \n A typical fluidized bed reactor is described in U.S. Pat. No. \n 4,482,687. A relatively low melt index (or high molecular weight) copolymer is prepared in the first reactor. The first reactor is generally Smaller in size than the Second reactor because only a portion of the final product is made in the first reactor. The mixture of polymer and an active catalyst is usually \n transferred from the first reactor to the Second reactor via an ",

The broad molecular \n weight distribution is reflected in an Mw/Mn ratio of about 18 to about 32, preferably about 20 to about 30. Mw is the weight average molecular weight, Mn is the number average \n molecular weight; and the Mw/Mn ratio can be referred to as the polydispersity index (PDI), which can be viewed as a measure of the breadth of the molecular weight distribution. \n The weight ratio of copolymer prepared in the high molecular weight reactor to copolymer prepared in the low \n molecular weight reactor can be in the range of about 0.8:1 to about 2.3:1, and is preferably in the range of about 0.9:1 to about 1.9:1. The optimum weight ratio is about 1.2:1 to about 1.5:1. This is also known as the split. The magnesium/titanium based catalyst System, ethylene, alpha-olefin, and hydrogen are continuously fed into the first reactor; the polymer/catalyst mixture is continuously trans \n ferred from the first reactor to the Second reactor; ethylene, alpha-olefin, and hydrogen, as well as cocatalyst are con 15 \n 25 \n 35 \n 40 \n 45 \n 50 \n 55 \n 60 \n 65 8 \n tinuously fed to the Second reactor.

The mole ratio of hydrogen to ethylene can be in the range of \n about 1.0:1 to about 3:1, and is preferably in the range of about 1.3:1 to about 2.2:1. The operating temperature is generally in the range of about 70° C. to about 110° C. As mentioned above, the temperature is preferably varied with the desired density. \n The total reactor pressure in the Second reactor is usually higher than that used in the first reactor because of higher ethylene partial pressures and high hydrogen/ethylene \n requirements. The pressure, i.e., the total pressure in each \n reactor, can be in the range of about 200 to about 450 psig and is preferably in the range of about 280 to about 400 psig. The ethylene partial pressure in the first reactor can be in the range of about 10 to about 100 psi and is preferably in the range of about 20 to about 60 psi. The ethylene partial \n preSSure in the Second reactor can be in the range of about 50 to about 120 psi and is preferably in the range of about 60 to about 110 psi. The upper limit of ethylene partial preSSure in the first reactor and the ethylene partial preSSure \n in the Second reactor are Set according to the amount of copolymer it is desired to produce in each of these reactors, \n i.e., to achieve the Split mentioned above. It is noted that increasing the ethylene partial pressure in the first reactor \n leads to an increase in ethylene partial pressure in the Second reactor. Generally, the ethylene partial preSSure roughly \n doubles in the second reactor over the first reactor. The \n balance of the total preSSure is provided by alpha-olefin \n other than ethylene and an inert gas Such as nitrogen. \n A typical fluidized bed reactor can be described as fol \n lows: \n The bed is usually made up of the same granular resin that is to be produced in the reactor. Thus, during the course of the polymerization, the bed comprises formed polymer particles, growing polymer particles, and catalyst particles \n fluidized by polymerization and modifying gaseous compo \n nents introduced at a flow rate or Velocity Sufficient to cause the particles to Separate and act as a fluid. The fluidizing gas is made up of the initial feed, make-up feed, and cycle (recycle) gas, i.e., comonomers and, if desired, modifiers and/or an inert carrier gas. \n The essential parts of the reaction System are the vessels, an interreactor transfer System; a vent recovery System; and, \n in each vessel: a bed, a gas distribution plate, inlet and outlet piping, a compressor, a cycle gas cooler, and a product \n discharge System. In each vessel, above the bed, there is a Velocity reduction Zone, and, in the bed, a reaction Zone. Both are above the gas distribution plate. \n A typical fluidized bed reactor is also described in U.S. \n Pat. No. 4,482,687. \n The gaseous feed Streams of ethylene, other gaseous alpha-olefins, and hydrogen, when used, are preferably fed \n to the reactor recycle line as well as liquid alpha-olefins and ",

The partially activated catalyst precursor is preferably injected into the fluidized \n bed as a Solid or a mineral oil slurry. The cocatalyst completes the activation. The product composition can be \n varied by changing the molar ratioS of the comonomers introduced into the fluidized bed. The product is continu ously discharged in granular or particulate form from the \n reactor as the bed level builds up with polymerization. The production rate is controlled by adjusting the catalyst feed \n rate. \n The hydrogen:ethylene molar ratio can be adjusted to control average molecular weights. The alpha-olefins (other than ethylene) can be present in a total amount of up to 15 percent by weight of the copolymer and, if used, are pref \n erably included in the copolymer in a total amount of about 1 to about 10 percent by weight based on the weight of the copolymer. \n Several Steps can be taken, in addition to temperature control, to prevent agglomeration. The product discharge \n line between the reactor and the product pot is often plugged up with chunks between intervals of product drops. A continuous purge flow of nitrogen or reactor gas in the line prevents the plugging problem. Also, coating the reactor \n Surface with a low Surface energy material is shown to be beneficial to slow down the rate of fouling build up. In addition, control of the electrostatic level in the bed prevents Static induced particle agglomeration. Static can be adjusted \n to a Satisfactory level by controlled use of reaction rate, avoidance of quick change of gas composition, Selective use of Static-neutralizing chemicals and Surface passivation with aluminum alkyls. \n It is preferred to control the Static in the reactor System during Start-up. If the Static is not controlled, Static induced layers of catalyst rich fines can form on the reactor Surfaces. These fines may, in turn, induce localized hot spots and the formation of chunkS. Reactor Surface passivation with an aluminum alkyl minimizes the formation of fines layers. This passivation is accomplished by first building up the \n aluminum alkyl concentration in the Start-up bed to about 300 to 1000 ppm based on the weight of the bed, and then fluidizing the bed with purified nitrogen or ethylene for \n Several hours. At the end of this passivation period, the reactor is purged while maintaining the circulation, the \n reaction conditions are established, and the reaction is kicked off by feeding catalyst into the system. If static still persists, additional purges or Selective use of Static neutral izing chemicals may become necessary to reduce the level of \n Static. \n The residence time of the mixture of reactants including gaseous and liquid reactants, catalyst, and resin in each \n fluidized bed can be in the range of about 1 to about 12 hours and is preferably in the range of about 2 to about 5 hours. \n The resin blend can be extruded into film in a conven \n tional extruder adapted for that purpose. Extruders and processes for extrusion are described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,814,135; 4,857,600; 5,076,988; and 5,153,382. Examples of various extruders, which can be used in forming the film are a single Screw type Such as one modified with a blown film die and air ring and continuous take off equipment, a blown film extruder, and a slot cast extruder. A typical Single Screw type extruder can be described as one having a hopper at its upstream end and a die at its downstream end. The hopper feeds into a barrel, which contains a Screw. The barrel can be smooth, but is preferably grooved. At the \n downstream end, between the end of the Screw and the die, is a Screen pack and a breaker plate. The Screw portion of the \n extruder is considered to be divided up into three Sections, the feed Section, the compression Section, and the metering Section, and multiple heating Zones from the rear heating 15 \n 25 \n 35 \n 40 \n 45 \n 50 \n 55 \n 60 \n 65 10 \n Zone to the front heating Zone, the multiple Sections and Zones running from upstream to downstream. If it has more \n than one barrel, the barrels are connected in Series. The length to diameter ratio of each barrel is in the range of about 16:1 to about 30:1. The extrusion can take place at tempera tures in the range of about 160 to about 270 degrees C. and is preferably carried out attemperatures in the range of about 180 to about 240 degrees C. \n The advantages of the invention are found in the high extrusion speed of the resin blend; the high bubble strength; and the high bubble stability. Thus, the blend can be extruded to thinner gauges at higher extrusion Speeds, par ticularly gauges of 0.5 mill or leSS. \n In order to maintain a constant production rate, increases in ethylene partial preSSure are accompanied by decreases in the amount of catalyst fed. Consequently, catalyst produc tivity is increased, an additional advantage of the process. \n Conventional additives, which can be introduced into the blend, are exemplified by antioxidants, ultraViolet absorbers, antistatic agents, pigments, dyes, nucleating agents, fillers, Slip agents, fire retardants, plasticizers, processing aids, \n lubricants, Stabilizers, Smoke inhibitors, Viscosity control agents, and crosslinking agents, catalysts, and boosters, \n tackifiers, and anti-blocking agents. Aside from the fillers, the additives can be present in the blend in amounts of about 0.1 to about 10 parts by weight of additive for each 100 parts by weight of polymer blend. Fillers can be added in amounts up to 200 parts by weight and more for each 100 parts by weight of the blend. \n Patents and patent application mentioned in this Specifi cation are incorporated by reference herein. \n Molecular weights are weight average molecular weights \n unless otherwise noted. \n The invention is illustrated by the following examples. \n EXAMPLES 1 to 6 \n The catalyst precursor used in example 1 is manufactured in two steps. In the first step, 390 gallons of tetrahydrofuran (THF) is added to a solution preparation vessel to which BHT (butylated hydroxytoluene) is added as an inhibitor to prevent peroxide formation. Then, 62.5 pounds of aluminum \n reduced titanium trichloride TiCl, or one part TiCl to 3 parts AlCl (by weight) and 150 pounds of magnesium \n chloride (MgCl) are added. The mixture is heated to a temperature of 65 to 75 degrees C., and held for a period of \n 4 hours to dissolve. The Solution is filtered to remove \n insolubles. Then, 220 pounds of Silica are charged to the \n vessel. The silica is slurried with the solution and the slurry is pumped to a jacketed holding tank maintained at a temperature of 35 degrees C. \n The Second Step involves Spray drying the above slurry. This is accomplished by continuously feeding the slurry to a spray dryer. Hot nitrogen is circulated through the drying chamber, and the THF is evaporated leaving the TiCl/Mg Cl/THF/silica complex as a solid powder. The solids are then dropped into a slurry tank pre-loaded with dry mineral \n oil. The slurry tank is then rolled for several hours to produce the catalyst used in example 1. It is Similar to the \n catalysts described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,376,062 and 4.293, \n 673. \n A magnesium/titanium alkoxide precursor, which is a Solid reaction product, is prepared according to illustrative \n embodiment II from U.S. Pat. No. 5,124,298 carried out on a Scale Sufficient to obtain 300 pounds of granular material. Analysis (average of two runs): 12.3 percent Mg, 7.55 percent Ti, 60.3 percent OEt, 0.93 percent o-cresol (Cl= 11.5 percent by charge balance). \n The activated precursor used in examples 2, 3, 5, and 6 is prepared as follows: ",

Then, a solution of 3.9 kilograms of SiCl, and 713 grams of TiCl in 6.6 kilograms of toluene is charged at Such a rate (15 to 20 minutes) as to keep the reaction temperature between 25 and 30 degrees C. The slurry is then stirred for 30 minutes and filtered through an internal filter plate. The solids are washed by re-slurrying in 15 kilograms of a 50/50 (by weight) mixture of hexane and toluene, and are then isolated by filtration. In like manner, the solids are washed twice with hexane and dried under moving nitrogen. The yield is 2,472 grams of yellow powder. Analysis: 10.7 weight percent Mg, 9.82 weight percent Ti; and 36.2 weight percent Cl. \n The vessel is recharged with 1,302 grams of the yellow powder and 5 kilograms of hexane. Then, 7.291 grams of 25 weight percent ethylaluminum dichloride in toluene are added at Such a rate (15 minutes) as to keep the temperature between 25 and 30 degrees C. Then, 1,175 grams of 1 Molar BC1 in heptane are added all at once. After stirring for 30 minutes at 25 degrees C., the slurry is filtered.

Example 4 compares the examples \n 2 and 3 resins with the example 1 resin. \n EXAMPLE 1. \n About 85 pounds of polyethylene having a melt index of 1.0 gram per 10 minutes and a density of 0.920 gram per cubic centimeter made with the example 1 catalyst are charged to a first reactor as a Seedbed. About 120 pounds of polyethylene having a flow index of 0.5 gram per 10 minutes \n and a density of 0.940 gram per cubic centimeter made with the example 1 catalyst are charged to a Second reactor as a \n seed bed. Comonomers are ethylene and 1-hexene. Both reactors are then purged with high purity nitrogen at 80 \n degrees C. for Several hours until the moisture content is below 10 ppm. Then, about 1500 cubic centimeters of 5 weight percent triethylaluminum (TEAL) in isopentane is \n charged to each reactor and circulated for a period of 4 hours. TEAL acts as a moisture Scavenger. The reactors are then given 2 high preSSure purges with nitrogen, and the \n conditions set forth in Table I are established in each reactor: \n TABLE I \n reactor first reactor second reactor \n temperature (C.) 85 110 \n pressure (psia) 3OO 345 \n C2 partial pressure 25 70 (psi) \n H2/C2 molar ratio O.O4 18O \n C6, C2 molar ratio 0.027 O.OO75 \n isopentane (mol%) 12 \n gas velocity (ft/sec) 1.75 1.70 \n Approximately 225 cubic centimeters per hour of 5 weight percent TEAL in isopentane are fed to the first \n reactor and 130 cubic centimeters per hour of 5 weight percent TEAL in isopentane are fed to the Second reactor to Serve as cocatalyst. Then, the example 1 catalyst feed is \n initiated at the rate of 7.5 cubic centimeters per hour using a slurry catalyst feeder. The ethylene partial pressure in the 15 \n 25 \n 35 \n 40 \n 45 \n 50 \n 55 \n 60 \n 65 12 \n first reactor is manipulated to result in a production rate of 30 pounds per hour of resin. The H2/C2 molar ratio and C6/C2 molar ratio are manipulated in the first reactor to result in a resin with a flow index of 0.25 to 0.50 decigram per minute and a density of 0.927 to 0.930 gram per cubic centimeter. The Split in the resin exiting the Second reactor, i.e., the final product, is 60/40 (weight percent), i.e., 60 percent high molecular weight resin and 40 percent low molecular weight resin. This is accomplished by manipu lating the production rate of resin in the Second reactor, which is, in turn, accomplished by adjusting the ethylene partial pressure. The melt index of the final product is about 800 grams per 10 minutes and the density is about 0.963 per cubic centimeter. At a total production rate of 50 pounds per hour (HMW+LMW), a total of 1100 pounds of resin are produced. The bulk resin properties are set forth in Table II as follows.

This is considered to be very \n beneficial for bubble stability. \n The resin Samples from examples 1 to 3 are compounded \n on a LCM-100 line (Long Continuous Mixer/Gear Pump Pelletizing System (LCM-100 G) from Kobe Steel, Ltd.

Precautions are taken to eliminate the possibility of tailoring (oxidative degradation) during the compounding step. The com \n pounded resin Samples are then extruded in a 50 millimeter \n Alpine TM film extruder having an 80 millimeter die and a 1.0 \n millimeter die gap, and evaluated. \n The example 1 resin Sample runs at a maximum line Speed \n of 105 feet per minute. The bubble is not stable at higher line Speeds and collapses. The dart impact Strength of this Sample \n is measured at 240 grams on a 1 mil film. The film cannot be down gauged to 0.5 mill because of inferior bubble stability. These results verify that the precautions taken to avoid tailoring are adequate. \n The examples 2 and 3 resin Samples demonstrate signifi cantly improved film properties. These samples run at a \n maximum line Speed of 240 feet per minute. This represents \n a 130 percent increase in bubble stability.

The present invention relates to catalysts, and par ticularly to Ziegler-Natta catalysts and to a method for making and using catalysts in polymerization reactions. \n BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION \n 0002 Ziegler-Natta catalysts are advantageously used in \n olefin polymerization reactions to produce Stereoregulated \n linear polymers. It is known that Ziegler-Natta catalysts may \n be formed by coating a Silica Support material with a magnesium-halide compound, a transition metal compound, electron donor compound(s) and an organo-aluminum \n cocatalyst. The transition metal is an active catalytic ingre dient and the magnesium-halide compound may also be \n thought of as being active to the extent that it acts as a Synergist to increase the overall catalytic productivity of the \n transition metal. The electron donor compounds and organo \n aluminum cocatalyst are important because they enable the Ziegler-Natta catalyst to catalyze polymerization of isotactic \n polymers. The Silica material is inactive and does not increase polymerization reaction rates. \n 0003. It is known that silica-based Ziegler-Natta catalysts may be produced from high-porosity Silica particles in the \n diameter range of about 10-100 microns, which may be coated with 1 or more relatively thin layers of a magnesium halide compound to form a catalyst Support, which may be \n treated with a transition metal to form a catalyst. However, this type of catalyst generally comprises a high ratio of \n inactive Silica relative to the active ingredients. Further, the catalyst Supports may need to be mechanically treated to produce generally Spherical, or spheroidal, catalyst Supports \n of the appropriate diameter and particle diameter distribu tion, which will form catalyst particles of the appropriate \n diameter and particle diameter distribution and, thus, will facilitate efficient polymerization reactions. \n 0004 U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,293,673 and 4,376,062, both to Hamer et al., disclose methods for forming Silica based catalysts with very Small Silica particles, no larger than about \n 0.05 micron, which are mixed in a slurry to form solid agglomerations comprising a number of Silica particles \n mixed with active ingredients. While Hamer utilizes silica particles which are very Small, the resulting catalysts Still \n comprise at least 10 wt % inert silica material. This is \n undesirable because the higher the relative amount of inert Silica material the lower the Overall activity of the catalyst, and the higher the amount of catalyst residues in a polymer \n formed therewith. Thus, the production costs of the polymer, per weight unit of catalyst, is higher for catalysts containing \n relatively large amounts of inert material. Further, higher amounts of catalyst residues may detrimentally affect poly mer processing and/or the physical properties of products \n made with the polymer. \n 0005 Thus, there is a need for an efficient and reliable method for producing catalyst Support materials, and ulti mately catalysts, which comprise a relatively Small percent \n age of inactive materials, and which have a relatively Smooth spherical or spheroidal shape and Suitable average \n particle diameter and particle diameter distribution. Mar. 2, 2006 \n SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION \n 0006 The invention comprises a method for making magnesium-halide Supports of a Specified particle shape, \n average diameter and particle diameter distribution, which comprises providing a non-aqueous Solution of a magne \n sium-halide containing Silica particles dispersed therein, and crystallizing the magnesium-halide about the Silica particles \n to provide the magnesium-halide Support, wherein the Sup port has an approximately spherical shape, an average \n particle diameter from about 10 to about 120 microns, and a particle diameter distribution from about 10 to about 150 \n microns. The invention further comprises methods for mak ing catalysts and using Same in polymerization reactions. \n The invention further comprises catalyst Supports and cata lysts. \n 0007 Catalysts of the invention may include transition metal compounds, organo-aluminum co-catalysts and/or \n electron donors and may be useful for the polymerization of olefins to provide polymers having good morphology and \n bulk density. \n BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS \n 0008 FIG. 1 is a photomicrograph of particles of 100% MgCl2 at 50x magnification; \n 0009 FIG. 2 is a photomicrograph of particles of 90% \n MgCl, and 10% CAB-O-SILE silica at 50x magnification; and \n 0010 FIG. 3 is a photomicrograph of particles of 98% MgCl, and 2% CAB-O-SILO silica at 50x magnification. \n DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED \n EMBODIMENTS \n 0011. The present invention generally concerns Ziegler Natta catalysts and processes for making and using Same, \n which may include coating a Silica Support material, acting as a Seeding agent, with a magnesium compound to form a \n Solid catalyst Support. The catalyst Support may be reacted \n with a transition metal, an internal electron donor, an organo-aluminum co-catalyst and an external electron donor \n to form a catalyst Suitable for, for example, various poly \n merization reactions. \n 0012. In a preferred process, a Silica Seeding agent is \n dispersed in a non-polar, non-ionic oil, for example, mineral \n oil, paraffin oil or Silicone oil, in a mixing apparatus Such as a simple paddle Stirrer operating at a few hundred rpms or \n a Ultra-Turrax(RT 50 Homogenizer with stirring speeds up to 10,000 rpms. Preferably, the ratio of silica seeding agent \n to oil is in the range of about 0.25 grams per liter to about 25.0 grams per liter, more preferably about 1.0 gram per liter \n to about 10.0 grams per liter. The Silica Seeding agent is \n described in more detail below. \n 0013 Anhydrous magnesium halide compound can be \n added to the dispersion of silica in oil, followed by addition \n of an alkanol Solvent Such as anhydrous ethanol, methanol, or 2-ethyl-1-hexanol. Alternatively, anhydrous ethanol, \n methanol or 2-ethyl-1-hexanol can be added to an anhydrous \n (i.e., less than about 0.5 wt % HO) magnesium-halide compound to form a Soluble complex, as described below. \n About 0.01 wt % to about 10.0 wt %, more preferably from \n about 0.1 wt % to about 5.0 wt %, and still more preferably ",

         "US 2006/0046928A1 \n from about 0.5 wt % to about 3.0 wt % of the silica seeding agent is used relative to the magnesium-halide compound. \n Generally, a higher ratio of magnesium-halide to Silica \n Seeding agent in the mixture results in a higher ratio of magnesium-halide to Silica in the catalyst Support formed and, consequently, a larger catalyst Support is expected to \n form because more magnesium-halide crystalizes onto the Silica Seeding agent. \n 0.014. The solvent is added in amounts from about 2 to 20 times, preferably about 6 times, the molar ratio of the magnesium-halide compound to facilitate the liquefying of \n the magnesium-halide compound at a lower temperature. \n U.S. Pat. No. 4,421,674 to Invernizzi et al. teaches, for \n example, that when the mole ratio of ethanol (“EtOH') to MgCl, is 102, the complex liquefies at 60° C.; at a mole ratio of EtOH to MgCl2 of 7.75 the complex liquefies at 80° C.; \n at a mole ratio of EtOH to MgCl, of 6.51 the complex liquefies at 90° C.; and at a mole ratio of EtOH to MgCl, of 5.43 the complex liquefies at 100° C. The mixture is initially translucent due to the Suspension of the magnesium-halide \n compound and the Silica Seeding agent. The mixture is \n heated to about 60° C. to about 140°C., preferably about 80° \n C. to about 120° C., until the solvent begins to reflux and the magnesium-halide compound goes into Solution, whereupon \n the mixture becomes transparent, and the temperature is \n maintained at the reflux temperature for about 0.25 hours to about 3.0 hours, preferably about 1.0 hour to about 2.0 hours, preferably with continuous stirring. It is possible to \n form the mixture without either the oil or the Solvent, or by mixing the ingredients in a different order, but the above \n described mixing operation has been shown to result in a well-dispersed mixture. \n 0015 The clear mixture, which includes a MgCl2.xEtOH complex (where X is an integer from 1-20), is rapidly transferred to a Second mixing apparatus containing a pre \n chilled hydrocarbon Solvent, Such as heptane, hexane, cyclo hexane, or other aliphatic or cycloaliphatic hydrocarbon \n which is miscible in the oil and which will not freeze at the \n temperatures necessary for the Solidification of the MgCl2.xEtOH complex. The hydrocarbon solvent is pre \n chilled, for example, to between ice (0° C.) and dry ice/ isopropanol temperatures (i.e., about -70° C. to -90° C.). The rapid temperature decrease causes almost all of the magnesium-halide compound to precipitate out of Solution \n and crystallize onto the Silica Seeding agent, thus coating the Silica Seeding agent to form a catalyst Support. The catalyst \n Support particles preferably include less than 10 wt % Silica, \n preferably no more than 5 wt % silica, and more preferably \n no more than 3 wt % Silica. \n 0016. After about 0.5 to 2 hours, preferably about 1 hour, \n the mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature and it is filtered. Approximately Spherical and/or Spheroidal Solid \n catalyst Support particles, each comprising at least one Silica Seeding agent with magnesium-halide crystals attached \n thereto, are collected and washed Several times with more hydrocarbon Solvent, until the hydrocarbon Solvent appears \n to be colorless, and are dried (e.g., vacuum dried) in a rotary evaporator at about 40 C. to 80 C., preferably at about 60 \n C., for 1 to 3 hours, preferably for about 2 hours. The term “approximately Spherical' or “approximately Spheroidal' \n means that all points on the Surface of the particle are within \n the range of radius r to 2r wherein r is the minimum radial \n distance between the center of the particle and the closest Mar. 2, 2006 \n point thereto on the Surface of the particle. The magnesium halide compound may alternately be crystallized onto the \n Silica Seeding agent with known Spray drying techniqueS or \n by gradually evaporating the Solvent in which it was origi \n nally dissolved. \n 0017 Next, the catalyst support is slowly added to about \n 10 to 50 moles of a transition metal compound for each mole of magnesium in the magnesium-halide compound at about \n -30 to 50 C., and the temperature of this mixture is raised \n to about 20 to 80°C., preferably about 30-60° C. An internal electron donor is added and the temperature is raised, generally with stirring, to about 80 to 130 C., preferably \n 100-110° C., and is kept at that level for about 1 to 3 hours, preferably about 2 hours. \n 0018. The internal electron donor compound, in general, \n is used in an amount from about 0.05 to about 2.0 moles, \n preferably about 0.1 to about 0.5 mole, for each mole of magnesium in the magnesium-halide compound. \n 0019. The result is a mixture comprising solid catalyst \n particles and unreacted transition metal compound and inter \n nal electron donor compound. \n 0020. The solid catalyst particles are filtered out and, \n preferably, extracted for about 1 to 3 hours, preferably about \n 2 hours, at about 110 to 140 C., more preferably about 125 C. with a mixture of transition metal compound (about 5 to 30 wt %, preferably about 10 wt %), and an inert solvent, Such as a C-C alkylbenzene, preferably ethylbenzene \n (about 70 to 85 wt %, preferably about 90 wt %) in a known “Soxhlet” extraction type arrangement. This extraction treat ment enhances catalyst activity and Stereospecificity. Alter \n natively, the Solid catalyst may receive any number of other \n known extraction treatments, which may, but need not, include a transition metal treatment. Alternatively, the cata lyst could simply be boiled in a Solution comprising a \n transition metal compound with or without an inert Solvent, \n i.e., a Solvent which will not react with the transition metal \n compound. U.S. Pat. No. 4,745,164 to Schweier et al. and \n U.S. Pat. No. 6,034,023 to Kersting et al., which are incor porated by reference herein, teach examples of extraction \n methods which may be utilized in the present invention. \n 0021. The Solid catalyst may be recovered by filtration, \n washed with an inert Solvent, Such as heptane, hexane, cyclohexane or other aliphatic or cycloaliphatic hydrocar \n bon, dried by draining off transition metal compound and \n Solvent, washed a Second time with the inert Solvent, and \n dried. \n 0022. The solid catalyst Support particles and/or catalyst \n particles preferably comprise about 0.01 wt % to about 10 wt \n % silica, more preferably about 0.1 wt % to about 5 wt % \n Silica. \n 0023 The solid catalyst Support particles and/or catalyst particles preferably have a weight percent ratio of Silica to \n magnesium-halide compound in the range of about 1:20 to \n 1:3, preferably from about 1:10 to 1:4. \n 0024. The catalyst may preferably be treated with an organo-aluminum co-catalyst and an external electron donor or other Stereoregulating agent to form a Ziegler-Natta \n catalyst, which may be used, for example, in polymerization \n reactions.

Preferred external electron donor compounds are disclosed below. \n 0.025 In such cases the organo-aluminum co-catalyst and \n the external electron donor may be contacted with the Solid catalyst Separately, in any order, or together, preferably at a \n temperature from about 0 to 200 C., more preferably from \n about 20 to 90° C., and preferably at a pressure of about 1 \n to 100 bar, more preferably from about 1 to 40 bar. \n 0.026 Preferably, the organo-aluminum co-catalyst is \n added in Such an amount that the molar ratio of the alumi \n num co-catalyst to the transition metal in the Solid catalyst \n is from about 10:1 to about 800:1, more preferably from \n about 20:1 to about 200:1. \n 0027. The external electron donor is used with the cata lyst in amounts ranging from about 1 to 100 moles, prefer \n ably 10 to 30 moles, for each mole of transition metal in the catalyst. Generally, it is highly preferred that an external \n electron donor, with or without the organo-aluminum co \n catalyst, be used in order to maintain a high level of Stereospecificity in polymers produced with the catalysts of \n the invention. \n 0028. A preferred silica seeding agent is a microspheroi \n dal silica (SiO2), for example, a fumed Silica Such as CAB-O-SIL(R-5 (Cabot Corporation; Midland, Mich.). Other Silica Seeding agents may include, for example, Aero \n sile) fumed silica, available from USA Midwest Degussa Corporation, 3500 Embassy Parkway Ste. 100, Akron Ohio \n 4.4333. \n 0029. The silica seeding agent is characterized by its relatively Small average particle diameter, i.e., preferably \n about 0.005-10 microns, more preferably about 0.001-5.0 microns, most preferably from about 0.01 microns to about 1.0 micron. The Silica Seeding agent has low porosity \n because of its lack of, or Small quantity of, pores. That is, it \n has a porosity of less than about 0.5 cc/gram as measured by nitrogen adsorption, which indicates that the Silica particles \n have relatively Smooth Surfaces. The Silica Seeding agent particles have relatively uniform spherical or spheroidal shape, i.e., approximately Spherical shape, and preferably \n having a radius which does not vary by more than about 20% from the center to any point on the Surface of the particle. The particles of the Silica Seeding agent have a relatively \n small particle diameter distribution, such that 50% of the Silica particles have particle diameters ranging from about \n 0.05 microns to about 0.5 microns. \n 0030 The small particle diameter of the silica seeding agent is significant because the resulting catalyst will ulti mately comprise a relatively Small percentage, i.e., less than \n 10 wt %, of inert silica material as compared to the total weight of the catalyst Support. Thus, the catalyst will operate \n more efficiently because a relatively larger portion of the \n Solid catalyst will comprise active catalytic material, i.e., the transition metal and the magnesium-halide Synergist. In preferred catalyst Supports the Silica component will be leSS Mar. 2, 2006 \n than 10 wt % of the total catalyst Support weight, more \n preferably about 0.1 wt % to about 5 wt %, and yet more \n preferably about 0.5 wt % to about 3.0 wt % of the catalyst Support formed by the above-described processes. Since the Silica Seeding agent provides a Surface upon which the magnesium-halide compound will crystallize, the Smooth \n approximately spherical shape and Small particle diameter \n distribution of the Silica Seeding agent will result in catalyst Support particles, and ultimately catalyst particles, with a \n relatively Smooth approximately spherical shape and Small \n particle diameter distribution. These qualities will contribute to an efficient polymerization process with a relatively Small \n amount of fines in polymers produced in reactions con \n ducted with the catalysts of the invention. This is an advan tage over other catalysts which, for example, may need to undergo various complex and expensive processes in order to acquire an approximately Spherical shape and/or accept \n able particle diameter and particle diameter distribution. \n 0031. The diameters of the catalyst support particles will \n range from about 5-150 microns, more preferably from \n about 20-60 microns, most preferably from about 20-40 microns. The particle size distribution of the catalyst Support particles is Such that 50% of the catalyst Support particles \n have particle diameters ranging from about 20 microns to \n about 60 microns. \n 0032. The catalyst particles will have diameters which are about 20%-50% smaller. For example, a support particle \n with a 70 micron diameter may result in a catalyst particle \n with a 50-60 micron diameter. The reason for this reduction \n in Size is as follows. It is generally known that ethanol dissolves the MgCl2 by first Swelling the structure of the solid MgCl. (MgCl2 has a layered structure. Ethanol occu pies the interstitial spaces between the MgCl2 layers.) AS \n more alcohol is added and/or the material is heated, this Structure continues to Swell or expand until the MgCl, layers Segregate and the MgCloEtOH complex becomes a liquid. \n When this complex is reacted with TiCl, the removal of \n ethanol causes the Structure and thus the particle to Shrink or diminish in size. Thus, the catalyst Supports and catalysts of \n the invention are notable for having relatively thick layers of active ingredients, referring to both the Synergistic magne \n sium-halide layer and active transition metal layer, on rela tively Small Silica particles. Again, this results in the overall percentage of inactive Silica delivered to a polymerization \n reactor to be lower than in other known processes. Conse quently, overall efficiency in the polymerization reactor will be higher. \n 0033 Preferably, catalyst Support particles and catalyst \n particles of the invention will each include one Silica Seed particle, or a Small group of Silica Seed particles comprising \n less than 10% of the total catalyst Support weight. In contrast \n to the present invention, other known catalysts typically comprise relatively large Silica particles or agglomerations \n of a number of very Small Silica particles within each catalyst Support particle Such that there is a relatively larger \n amount (e.g., up to 50 wt %) of inert Silica in the catalyst particle. \n 0034. The magnesium compound is an inorganic solid \n magnesium-halide compound containing at least one halo \n gen atom, Such as magnesium chloride, magnesium bromide \n and magnesium iodide, as well as mixed halogen oxides or hydroxides like chloromagnesium hydroxide, bromomagne ",

Titanium compounds useful in preparing the Solid \n catalyst component include the halogenides of tri- or tet \n ravalent titanium.

One function is to block “coordinately unsaturated' Sites on the magnesium \n compound So that the active site, the transition metal com \n pound, will not attach to those Sites. The other function is to \n reduce the “coordinately unsaturated” environment around \n the bound active site in order to improve its Stereospecificity. \n Both results are the Same, i.e. the electron donors improve the isotacticity or Stereoregularity of polymers produced \n with the catalyst. The reason for this is that a “coordinately \n unsaturated' Site has a lower energy barrier for binding \n propylene in various configurations, i.e., it can bond to \n propylene in multiple ways, leading to a reduction in poly \n mer isotacticity and Subsequently lower polymer crystallin \n ity. Lower polymer crystallinity results in lower polymer melting points and increased hydrocarbon (e.g., xylene, \n decalin, or heptane) Solubles. A “coordinatively Saturated” Site will predominately bond to the active site in only one way. As a result, a coordinatively Saturated Site produces \n uniform or isotactic polypropylene. \n 0.038 Internal electron donor compounds which may be used in the preparation of the Solid catalytic component \n include, at least, mono or polyfunctional carboxylic acids, carboxylic anhydrides, or carboxylic esters, and also \n ketones, ethers, alcohols, lactones or organophosphorous or organosilicon compounds. \n 0.039 Preferred internal electron donor compounds included carboxylic acid derivatives and, in particular, phthalic acid derivatives having the general formula (I): Mar. 2, 2006 \n (I) \n wherein X and Y each represent a chlorine or bromine atom or a C-Co alkoxy group, or X and Y taken together represent an oxygen atom forming an anhydride function. \n Particularly preferred internal electron donor compounds are \n phthalic esters of formula (I) wherein X and Y each are a C-Cs alkoxy group, such as a methoxy, ethoxy, n-propyloxy, isopropyloxy, n-butyloxy, Sec-butyloxy, or tert-butyloxy \n group.

Polymerization processes of this type are known; their special feature compared with other similar pro cesses is the special embodiment of the catalyst system, and the processes disclosed in European Laid-Open application Nos. 17,895 and 144,021, European Pat. No. \n 45,977, Australian Pat. No. 543,049 and British Pat. No. 2,143,834 may be mentioned as prototypes for the pres \n ent case. \n The special embodiments of the catalyst systems are produced in order to achieve certain aims, such as the following: \n The catalyst system should be easy to prepare and give an increased yield of polymer having a very large \n isotactic fraction. In addition, particularly because of the thermodynamics of the procedure, easy molecular weight regulation, in particular with hydrogen, is of great importance. \n The catalyst system should moreover produce poly mers having special morphological properties, for ex \n ample uniform particle size and/or smaller fractions of very fine particles and/or a high bulk density. In addi tion to these parameters which are important for con trolling the polymerization systems, working up the \n polymers and/or processing the latter, a low halogen content in the polymer is of importance, particularly with regard to corrosion problems; this can be achieved by increasing the polymer yield and/or by means of a catalyst system which contains very little halogen. \n Some of these aims can be achieved by the prior art only by means of very expensive processes, as is the 2 \n case, for example, with the process according to U.S. \n Pat. No. 4,399,054, or when other aims are neglected. For example, British Pat. No. 2,049,709 discloses a process in which a magnesium halide, a titanium halide and an electron donor are applied to a metal oxide car rier. However, the polymer obtained has a compara \n 10 \n 15 \n 20 \n 25 \n 30 \n 35 \n 45 \n 50 \n 55 \n 60 \n 65 tively low isotacticity. \n European Laid-Open application Nos. 14,523 and \n 171,200 and British Pat. Nos. 2,101,609 and 2,101,611 describe catalyst systems whose titanium component is \n obtained by treating a solid, inorganic oxide with an organic magnesium compound, a Lewis base and tita \n nium tetrachloride, it being necessary in addition to use a halogenating agent which is not titanium tetrachloride and/or an organic compound of the metals boron, alu \n minum, silicon or tin or a boron trihalide or a halogen containing alcohol. Despite an expensive and tedious preparation procedure, the productivity of the corre sponding catalyst system is unsatisfactory. \n U.S. Pat. No. 4,467,044 discloses a catalyst system which contains, as a titanium component, a silica car rier, a magnesium halide and/or manganese halide, a \n titanium halide and an electron donor. In order to ob tain catalyst systems having relatively high productiv \n ity, additional treatment with an organometallic com pound of a metal of groups I to III of the periodic table is indispensable here. However, the productivity and stereospecificity of the catalysts prepared in this manner \n are, in absolute terms, low. The known processes are thus unsatisfactory, in par ticular with regard to high isotacticity and good mor phology coupled with good productivity. It is an object of the present invention to provide a titanium component which, compared with the prior art processes, has high productivity and is at the same time capable of giving polymers having high isotacticity and good morphology. \n We have found that this object is achieved by a cata lyst system which contains a titanium component (1) prepared in three stages in a particular manner from (I) magnesium chloride, (II) a certain alkanol, (III) a cer tain carrier comprising finely divided inorganic oxide carrier material which has been pretreated with an al kylchlorosilane, (IV) titanium tetrachloride and (V) a specially selected phthalic acid derivative. The present invention accordingly relates to a pro cess for the preparation of homopolymers of propene and copolymers of propene with minor amounts of other C2-C12-a-monoolefins, in particular C2-C6-a- monoolefins, by polymerization, in particular dry-phase polymerization, of the monomer or monomers at from 20 to 160 C., in particular from 50 to 120° C., under from 1 to 100, in particular from 20 to 70, bar using a Ziegler-Natta catalyst consisting of \n (1) a titanium component which contains titanium, magnesium, chlorine and a benzenecarboxylic acid de \n rivative on a carrier, (2) an aluminum component of the formula \n AR3, \n where R is alkyl of not more than 8, in particular not \n more than 4, carbon atoms, \n and \n (3) a silane component of the formula ",

Regarding the novel process, the following may be stated specifically: Provided that the defining feature is taken into ac count, the polymerization process as such can be car ried out in virtually all relevant conventional techno logical embodiments, for example as a batchwise, cyclic or, in particular, continuous process, either as a suspen sion polymerization processor, in particular, a dryphase polymerization process. The stated technological em bodiments, i.e. the technological variants of the poly merization of a-monoolefins by the Ziegler-Natta method, are well known from the literature and in prac tice and therefore require no further description. For the sake of completeness, it may be stated that, in the novel process, it is also possible to regulate the molecular weights of the polymers by the relevant con ventional measures, for example using regulators such as, in particular, hydrogen. Regarding the composition of the novel catalysts, the following may be stated specifically: (1) The liquid inert hydrocarbon to be used for the preparation of the titanium component may be a hydro \n carbon of the type usually combined with titanium com ponents for catalyst systems of the Ziegler-Natta type \n without causing damage to the catalyst system or its titanium component. Examples of suitable hydrocar bons are pentanes, hexanes, heptanes, gasolines and cyclohexane. \n The finely divided magnesium chloride (I) likewise to be used may be a relevant conventional one. It should be essentially anhydrous, i.e. its water content should not exceed 1% by weight of the total amount of magne \n sium chloride. \n The alkanois (II) to be used for the preparation of the titanium component (1) may be conventional ones; they should advantageously have relatively high purities. Examples of suitable alkanols are ethanol, n-propyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, n-butyl alcohol, isobutyl alcohol and tert-butyl alcohol, n-butanol being particu larly suitable. The carrier (III) furthermore to be used generally contains, as a base material, an aluminosilicate or, in particular, silica; it is important that it has the required properties; it has been found that the relevant conven tional commercial carrier materials which meet the stated specification are suitable. Alkylchlorosilanes suit able for the preparation of the carrier are monoalkyltri chlorosilanes, dialkyldichlorosilanes and trialkyl mono chlorosilanes, trialkylmonochlorosilanes being particu larly suitable and trimethylchlorosilane being preferred. \n The titanium tetrachloride (IV) likewise to be used for the preparation of the titanium component (1) should be one which is conventionally used in Ziegler Natta catalyst systems. \n Furthermore, the phthalic acid derivative (V) defined above can be a commercial one; it should advanta geously be very pure. It has been found that phthaloyl dichloride is very particularly suitable for the purpose 10 \n 15 \n 20 \n 25 \n 30 \n 35 \n 45 \n 50 \n 55 \n 65 6 \n according to the invention; however, phthalic anhy dride and the dialkyl phthalates, in particular di-n-butyl \n phthalate, are also suitable. The alkane to be used for the preparation of the tita nium component (1) in stage (1.3) may likewise be a \n conventional one; it should advantageously have a rela tively high purity. \n The preparation of the titanium component (1) is \n simple and can be carried out by the skilled worker without explanations. Regarding stages (1.1), (1.2) and (1.3), it is merely necessary to state that the isolation of the particular resulting solid is advantageously carried \n out by filtration under suction, which in stage (1.1) should advantageously be followed by washing with a liquid, inert hydrocarbon until the latter no longer ab \n sorbs any titanium tetrachloride. It has been found that it may also be advantageous if the solid-phase reaction \n product obtained in the second substance (1.1.2.a) is isolated before being used in the third substage (1.1.3), for example by evaporation to dryness. \n (2) Suitable aluminum components (2) of the stated \n formula are the relevant conventional ones of this for \n mula; they are sufficiently well known from the litera \n ture and in practice to require no further discussion. An outstanding member is, for example, triethylaluminum. (3) The silane component (3) which completes the catalyst system is, in particular, a trialkoxy(alkyl)aryl \n or dialkoxydi(alkyl)arylsilane of the stated formula. Outstanding members are triethoxytolyl-, triethoxy(e- thylphenyl)-, dimethoxyditolyl- and dimethoxydi(ethyl phenyl)silane; other examples are trimethoxytolyl-, trimethoxy(ethylpheny)- and trimethoxyphenylsilane, triethoxyphenylsilane, dimethoxydiphenylsilane, and diethoxyditolyl-, diethoxydi(ethylphenyl)- and diethox ydiphenylsilane. \n The novel process permits homo- and copolymers, for example of the binary or ternary type, including \n block copolymers, of propene with minor amounts of \n other C2-C12-a-monoolefins to be prepared in an ad vantageous manner, particularly suitable a-monoolefins as comonomers be polymerized being ethene, but-1-ene, 4-methylpent-1-ene and hex-1-ene; other suitable exam \n ples are n-oct-1-ene, n-dec-1-ene. and n-dodec-1-ene. \n EXAMPLE 1. \n Preparation of the titanium component (1) \n The process is carried out as follows: first (1.1) in a first stage, a solid-phase intermediate is prepared from (I) finely divided magnesium chloride, \n (II) n-butanol, (III) a carrier consisting of a finely divided, porous, inorganic oxide carrier material which has a particle \n diameter of from 20 to 45 um, a pore volume of 1.75 cm/g and a surface area of 320 m2/g, is of the formula SiO2 and has been pretreated with trimethylchlorosi \n lane in such a way that the carrier material and the alkylchlorosilane are combined twice in n-heptane with constant through mixing by means of stirring at 65 C., \n in each case 4.2 molar parts, i.e. a total of 8.4 molar parts, of the alkylchlorosilane being used per 10 molar \n parts of the carrier material, and in each case 50 molar parts, i.e. a total of 100 molar parts, of the hydrocarbon being used per 10 molar parts of the alkylchlorosilane, \n and the combined substances are kept in each case for 0.5 hour, i.e. for a total of 1 hour, at 85 C., and the ",

         "4,148,754 1. \n PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OFA \n CATALYST AND CATALYST USED IN OLEFN \n POLYMERZATION \n The present invention relates to the preparation of a catalyst for the polymerization of ethylene and higher \n 1-olefins. \n A process for the preparation of a catalyst for use in the polymerization of olefins has been described, in which organic alkali metal compounds are allowed to act on the hydroxyl groups of finely dispersed metal \n oxides, for example silicon dioxide, and the reaction product is reacted subsequently with a metal halide selected from group VIIa of the Periodic system, espe cially manganese hexachloride (cf. U.S. Pat. No. 3,205,177). The solid obtained gives a catalyst suitable for use in the olefin polymerization when combined with a metallo-organic compound the metal of which is selected from one of groups I to III of the periodic system. These catalysts, however, have a low activity and produce only 1.4 kg of polyethylene per gram of manganese in 3 hours at a polymerization temperature \n of 95 C. and under an ethylene pressure of 98 atmo spheres. \n A further process comprises impregnating a solid \n carrier, for example calcium carbonate, with an alumi num-organic compound and treating it subsequently \n with an excess of titanium tetrachloride, whereby re \n duced titanium trichloride forms a sediment on the \n carrier (cf. British Pat. No. 927,969). Thereafter the excess of titanium tetrachloride must be removed. The \n polymerization activity of the catalysts thus obtained, \n however, is likewise so low that the residual catalyst must be removed from the polyolefin produced. Furthermore, there are known catalysts used in the polymerization of olefins, which are obtained by treat ing an oxide, hydroxide, carbonate or sulfate of magne sium or calcium with an aluminum-organic compound and subsequently reacting the compound obtained with \n a mixture of halides of titanium and vanadium (cf. Ger man Auslegeschrift No. 2,140,326). In the preparation of these catalysts the aluminum-organic compound and \n the transition metal compound of titanium and vana 10 \n 15 \n 20 \n 25 \n 30 \n 35 \n dium are used in an amount such that the separation of 45 an excess of these compounds may be dispensed with, but on the other hand, active catalysts for the polyolefin polymerization cannot be obtained when using as transi tion metal compounds solely titanium compounds. A catalyst, for example, which had been prepared by re acting magnesium oxide with aluminum triethyl and by subsequently treating the product obtained with tita nium tetrachloride yielded per hour only 19.5g of poly ethylene per 1 gram of titanium under an ethylene pres sure of 39 atmospheres. A secondary treatment of the polyethylene obtained was necessary for removing the \n residual catalyst because of the discoloration of poly ethylene. \n Finally a process for the preparation of supported \n catalysts has been disclosed, in which an excess of a metallo-organic magnesium or aluminum compound is \n allowed to act on silicon dioxide, aluminum oxide or a \n mixture consisting of silicon dioxide and aluminum oxide having superficial hydroxyl groups and the reac \n tion product is reacted, after the excess of said organo metallic compound has been removed by washing, with an excess of a halogen compound of a transition metal selected from one of groups IVa, Va or VIa of the 50 \n 55 \n 65 2 \n periodical system, and the excess of the transition metal compound is removed by washing with a solvent. By washing out the metallo-organic compounds of magne \n sium or aluminum and the transition metals there are formed highly diluted solutions, which must be decom posed subsequently. As a consquence thereof, undesired \n waste products are obtained, which are contained in the waste water (cf. German Offenlegungsschrift No. \n 2,109,273). It has now been found that a catalyst suitable for use in the polymerization of 1-olefins can be obtained by starting from the reaction product of silicon dioxide and/or a metal oxide with a Grignard compound as a carrier and a soluble titanium compound, which cata lyst gives high yields and allows a good control of the molecular weight by means of hydrogen without mak ing a separation of the excess of metallo-organic com pounds and/or of titanium compounds from the carrier \n necessary. The present invention consequently provides a pro cess for the preparation of a catalyst by reacting the reaction product of silicon dioxide and/or aluminum oxide and 1. a halogen-containing magnesium-organic compound and 2. a halogen compound of a transition metal (component A) with a metallo-organic compound (component B), which comprises reacting a silicon di oxide and/or aluminum oxide having a hydroxyl con tent of from 0.5 to 50 mmols/g first with a magnesium compound of the formula RMgX, in which R is a hy droxarbon radical having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms and X is chlorine, bromine or iodine, in the presence of a diluent, in an amount of from 0.05 to 1 mol of magne sium compound per mol of hydroxyl groups of the carrier and reacting thereafter the solid reaction prod uct in suspension with a halogen-containing titanium (IV) compound of the formula TiX(OR))4-, in which n is an integer of from 1 to 4, X is chlorine or bromine and R is a hydrocarbon radical having of from 1 to 12 \n carbon atoms, in an amount of from 0.01 to 1 mol of titanium compound per mol of hydroxyl groups of the carrier, to obtain the component A. Suitable carriers are porous oxides or mixed oxides of silicon and/or aluminum having a specific surface of from 50 to 1000 m2/g, preferably from 100 to 800, espe cially from 150 to 650 and a pore volume in the range of from 0.2 to 2 ml/g, preferably of from 0.4 to 2, espe cially of from 0.6 to 1.7 ml/g. The particle size is in the range of from 1 to 500 am, preferably from 10 to 200 um, especially of from 20 to 100 um. The number of hydroxyl groups depends on the specific surface and the temperature of the preliminary treatment and is in the range of from 0.5 to 50 mmols preferably of from 1 to 20 mmols, especially of from 1.5 to 10 mmols, hydroxyl groups per gram of carrier. Several of these oxides are prepared especially for being used as a carrier of sup ported catalysts. They are commercial products. Prior to the reaction of the hydroxyl groups of the carrier with the halogen-containing magnesium-organic compounds the absorbed water must be removed by drying at a temperature of from 120 to 800° C., prefera bly of from 200 to 500 C. The number of hydroxyl groups (mmol of hydroxyl groups per gram of carrier) may be modified by said treatment at high temperature, whereby it is reduced with an increasing temperature. After drying the carrier is kept under an inert gas atmosphere, for example nitrogen or argon, with the \n exclusion of air or water. ",

The Grignard compound reacts in known manner with the hydroxyl groups placed at the surface of the carrier at a temperature below 100° C. while splitting off hydrocarbon, with the addition of -Mgx to the oxygen of the hydroxyl group according to the follow ing equation: \n - - \n -o-it-oh -- RMgX -o-i-o-Mex -- R-H \n -O -O \n Consequently one mol of magnesium alkyl chloride is chemically bound per mole of hydroxyl groups of the carrier. The number of hydroxyl groups of the carrier may, consequently, be determined by volumetric or chromatographic analysis of the hydrocarbon formed or by retitration of the excess of Grignard compound. The reaction of the solid carrier with the Grignard compound may be carried out in the following way: The solid carrier is suspended in an inert diluent, the dissolved Grignard compound is added at a tempera ture of from -20° to 150° C., preferably of from 0 to 120° C., especially of from 20' to 100° C., and allowed to act on the suspension for a period of from 0.5 to 20, preferably from 0.5 to 10, especially from 0.5 to 2, hours. The proportion of Grignard compound and solid carrier is chosen such that from 0.05 to 1, preferably from 0.1 to 0.95, mol of alkyl magnesium halide is used per mole of hydroxyl groups of the carrier. The magne sium compound is applied on the carrier quantitatively in said process. The reaction is completed when no more magnesium can be detected in the supernatant \n solution after the solid carrier has settled. \n Suitable diluents are all solvents inert with regard to Grignard compounds, for example saturated hydrocar bons or ethers, for example pentane, hexane, heptane, diethyl ether, tetrahydrofurane, or mixture of both types of compounds. After completion of the above reaction the diluent is separated by filtration and drying or directly by distilla tion, at a temperature of from 50 to 200 C., if it con tains an ether. The separation of the diluent is necessary for removing the ether, which has been used for the preparation of the Grignard compound and formed a complex with said compound, owing to the fact that the ether also reacts with the titanium compound while forming a complex and deactivates the catalyst.

The solid carrier impregnated with the Grignard compound is thereafter suspended again in an inert dispersing agent, preferably in an inert hydrocarbon. A dispersing agent conventionally used for the polymeri zation under low pressure according to Ziegler is \n chosen preferably. When not an ether but a saturated hydrocarbon is used for the preparation of the Grignard compound, the \n diluent need not be separated and the titanium(IV) com pound may be directly added to the reaction mixture. Suitable inert dispersing agents are aliphatic or cycloali phatic hydrocarbons, for example pentane, hexane, heptane, cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane as well as \n aromatic hydrocarbons, for example benzene, toluene, \n xylene, and furthermore benzine or Diesel oil fractions, which have been carefully purified of oxygen, sulfur compounds and moisture, may be used. To the suspension obtained there is added subse quently a halogen-containing titanium(IV) compound, at a temperature of from 20 to 140 C., preferably of from 30 to 130 C, especially of from 40 to 120° C. and the mixture is stirred at this temperature until a titanium compound can no longer be detected in the suernatant solution, generally within a period of from 2 to 20 \n hours.

Titanium tetrachloride, TiCl2(O-i-C3H)2 and TiCl 3(O-i-C3H7) are used preferably. The proportion between the titanium compound and \n the solid carrier is chosen such that of from 0.01 to 1, preferably of from 0.05 to 1, especially of from 0.1 to 1, mol of titanium compound is used per 1 mole of hy droxyl groups of the solid carrier. The proportion of, Grignard compound to the tita \n nium compound is chosen such that the atomic ratio of magnesium to titanium in the catalyst component A is in the range of from 0.01 to 10, preferably of from 0.05 to 5, especially of from 0.1 to 2. The catalyst component A thus obtained is used ei ther directly in the form of the suspension or after re \n moval of the diluent and drying.

There may be mentioned, by way of example, 1,4-butadiene, isoprene, 2-phenyl butadiene, 1,4-pen tadiene, 1,3-pentadiene and myrcene. The reaction products of Al(i-C4H9)3 or Al(i-C4H9)2H with isoprene are used preferably. They comprise, for example, com pounds of the formula \n R3 \n Z-A-R-Y-Z \n wherein Y means the groups \n R3 R4 R4 \n -Al-, - Al- crA 1-, o / N A. N / R4 \n Z is hydrogen, the isobutyl group, the dihydroisoprenyl group or an oligomer of this group, R is the isobutyl radical, R4 is the tetrahydroisoprenylene radical and n is an integer of from d1 to 20, the compounds of the for \n mula \n Al-R-Y-R \n wherein Y, R3 and Rand n are defined as above.

A compound of this type being commercially available under the name \"aluminum isoprenyl' is used particularly preferable. Further suitable compounds for component B are chlorine-containing aluminum-organic compounds, for example dialkyl aluminum monochlorides of the for mula R52AlCl or alkyl aluminum sesqui-chlorides of the formula R53Al2Cl3, wherein R5 is a hydrocarbon radical having from 1 to 16 carbon atoms, preferably an alkyl radical having from 1 to 16, especially from 2 to 12 carbon atoms. There may be mentioned, by way of example (C2H5)2AlCl, (i-C4H9)2AlCl, (C2H5)3Al2Cl3. Especially suitable compounds for the component B are aluminum trialkyls of the formula AllR3 or alumi num dialkyl hydrides of the formula AllR2H, wherein R5 is a hydrocarbon radical having from 1 to 16 carbon atoms, preferably an alkyl radical having from 1 to 16, especially from 2 to 4 carbon atoms, for example Al(C2H5)3, Al(C2H5)2H Al(C3H7)2H, Al(i-C4H9)3, Al(i- C4H9)2H. The conversion of the titanium(IV) compound of component A into the polymerization active compound having a lower valency is advantageously performed during the polymerization by the metallo-organic com pound (component B) at a temperature of from 20' to 150° C., preferably of from 60' to 140 C. Component A may also be treated with a metallo organic compound prior to polymerizing and be used subsequently in the polymerization at a temperature of 10 \n 15 \n 20 \n 25 \n 30 \n 35 \n 45 \n 50 \n 55 \n 60 \n 65 6 \n from -30 to 150° C., preferably of from 0 to 100° C., with a molar ratio between metallo-organic compound and titanium compound of from 0.2:1 to 3:1, preferably from 0.5:1 to 2:1. If a chlorine-containing metallo organic compound is used it is advisable to wash the reaction product obtained with fresh dispersing agent. Thereafter it is activated with a further metallo-organic compound at a temperature of from 20 to 150 C. When using the catalyst according to the invention at least one 1-olefin of the formula R6-CH=CH2, wherein R6 is hydrogen or a straight chain or branched alkyl radical having from 1 to 10, preferably from 1 to 8, carbon atoms, is polymerized. Examples of such olefins are ethylene, propylene, butene-1, hexene-1, 4-methyl-pentene-1, octene-1. Ethylene is preferably \n polymerized alone or as a mixture consisting of at least 70% by weight of ethylene and at most 30% by weight \n of a further 1-olefin of the above formula. Ethylene is especially polymerized either alone or as a mixture of at least 92% by weight of ethylene and at most 8% by \n weight of a further 1-olefin of the above formula. The molecular weight of the polymer is controlled in known manner, preferably by using hydrogen. The polymerization may be carried out in solution, in suspension or in the gaseous phase, continuously or \n discontinuously, at a temperature of from 20 to 150 C., \n preferably of from 60 to 140 C., under a pressure of from 0.5 to 50 bars. It is carried out preferably under the technically interesting pressure in the range of from 1 to \n 40 bars. \n Thereby the titanium compound is used in a concen \n tration of from 0.005 to 1.5, preferably of from 0.05 to 1, mmol per liter of dispersing agent or reactor volume. The metallo-organic compound is used in a concentra \n tion of from 0.5 to 10 mmols, preferably of from 2 to 6 mmols, per liter of dispersing agent or reactor volume. Higher concentrations are also possible principally. The polymerization in suspension or solution is car \n ried out in a conventional inert solvent for low pressure processes according to Ziegler, which have been de \n scribed above. \n The process according to the invention has the ad vantage that excessive metal compounds do not have to be removed from the catalyst component A by washing, owing to the fact that both the halogen-containing mag nesium-organic compound used and the halogen-con taining titanium(IV) compound react completely with the carrier. Consequently, no washing liquids are formed from which the metal compounds must be sepa rated prior to the secondary treatment. As a conse quence thereof there are formed no metal-containing waste water or slurries. During the polymerization of ethylene and higher 1-olefins the catalyst according to the invention gives high catalyst yields under low pres \n sure, for example of from 1 to 7 bars, such that the magnesium/titanium and aluminum compound may \n completely remain in the polymer; a discoloration of the polyolefin or corrosion phenomena on the processing machines do not occur. Thus expensive operations such as a decomposition of the catalyst and a removal of the catalyst may be dispensed with. Carrying out the poly merization under a higher pressure permits use of a still smaller quantity of catalyst, as the catalyst yield is highly improved with an increasing polymerization \n pressure. The catalyst according to the invention is especially suitable for the polymerization of ethylene in the gase ",

The use of oxide carriers having a particle size of more than 30 Jum, which may be obtained for example by separating fine particles by sieving, prevents finely divided catalysts or polymer \n parts from being carried out of the fluidized bed and forming deposits in exterior zones of the reactor. The catalyst according to the invention permits prep aration of a polymer, the powder in bulk of which has a high air permeability and thus may directly be used in the processing by injection molding or extrusion with out previous granulation. A good air permeability of the powder in bulk in the extruder feeding zone prevents an incorporation of air into the molten polymer, which \n would cause a formation of bubbles in the finished part. The porous silicon dioxide having one or more sur face OH groups is designated as \"silicic acid' in the examples. For determining the number of hydroxyl groups of \n the carrier 10.0 g of the dried silicic acid are reacted under an argon atmosphere while refluxing and stirring with a solution of 500 mmols of n-propyl magnesium chloride in 500 ml of diethyl ether, for a period of 4 hours. After settling of the silicic acid magnesium is retitrated in the supernatant solution by way of com plexometry. The titanium content of component A is determined colorimetrically by using hydrogen peroxide (cf. G. O. \n Muller, Praktikum der quantitativen chemischen Ana lyse, 4th edition, (1957), page 243). For the polymerization in suspension there is used a hydrated Diesel oil fraction having a boiling range of \n from 140 to 200 C. \n The melt index of the polymer is determined accord ing to DIN (German Industrial Standard) 53,735, at 190° C., by using a load of 5 kg for is and of 15 kg for i15. The reduced specific viscosity (RSV) is determined with a solution of decahydronaphthalene at 135 C. at a \n concentration of 1 g/b 1. The bulk density is determined by weighing 100 cm of polyethylene powder. The air permeability is determined in the following manner: 100 cm3 of polyethylene powder are placed in a graduated cylinder, which has an inner diameter of 3 cm and a fritted glass bottom, and air suctioned through the powder at a rate of flow of 4 l/h; the pressure de crease occuring in the powder in bulk is determined. The air permeability is then determined in the following \n nanner: \n height of the package X flow velocity air permeability (L) = diameter of the cylinder X pressure loss. \n In the present invention L is 0.023/A p - 1, whereby A p is millimeters of the water column and 1 mm water column corresponds to the pressure loss of the glass frit. The diamension of L is (cm . . sec/g). All solvents are distilled under an inert gas atmo sphere having a purity of at least 99.995% in a circula tion apparatus while passing over benzophenone potas sium and are withdrawn under an inert gas atmosphere.

The solvent is withdrawn thereafter in a rotary evaporator and the solid product is dried for 2 hours at 120° C. under 0.5 torr. Thereafter the solid product is suspended in 500 ml of n-heptane under an argon atmo \n sphere, 20.3 g of titanium tetrachloride (1.0 mmol of titanium per 1 g of silicic acid) are added and the mix ture is stirred for 7 hours at 90° C. Heptane is thereafter withdrawn at 120° C. in the rotary evaporator under atmospheric pressure. 128 g of a flowable powder is \n obtained. \n The titanium analysis reveals 39.8 mg of titanium per 1 g of the component A.

Hydrogen is then introduced until a pressure of 2 bars is attained and ethylene is \n introduced in an amount sufficient to maintain a total \n pressure of 5.9 bars. After 2 hours of polymerization at 85 C. the polyethylene powder is separated from the \n dispersing agent by filtration and dried for 15 hours at 95° C. in vacuo. 115 g of polyethylene are obtained having an is value of 9.3 and a bulk density of 330g/1. The yield of polyethylene was 24,000 g per 1 g of titanium or 958g per 1 g of the catalyst component A. \n EXAMPLE 2 \n Ethylene is polymerized in the presence of 0.22 g of the catalyst component A described in Example 1 under the same conditions as in Example 1, but by using in stead of aluminum triethyl 1.98 g of aluminum triisobu tyl. After 2 hours there are obtained 145g of polyethyl ene having a melt index is of 7.9 and a bulk density of 350 g/1. The RSV value is 1.84 g dl/g.

The impeller promotes Some radial mixing, but mainly assures that the bottom Section of the residence time pot does not experience SuS pended solid buildup. \\n After activator has been added to the catalyst precursor Slurry in one or two steps, additional activator is added as a last step prior to entry into the reactor. Preferably, this \\n addition occurs within 30 minutes and preferably within less than 15 minutes of actual injection of the catalyst precursor \\n Slurry into the reactor. The activator can be in Solution in an inert Solvent (Such as a high Viscosity fluid carrier or a lower Viscosity Solvent) or added as pure component. It is essential \\n that a mixer, preferably an additional Static mixer element, be located immediately downstream of the addition point of \\n the additional activator. It is also important to keep the Slurry flowing to assure that no plugs form in the catalyst feed line. \\n Additional activator is fed to provide for sufficient activation of the catalyst plus a Small additional amount to Scavenge \\n impurities in the polymerization reactor. The total amount of \\n this additional “topping off activator can be about 0.1 to \\n about 75 percent by mol of the total amount of the activator \\n used for the activation of the precursor. Addition of all of the activator to the catalyst precursor eliminates mass transfer problems, which would prevent the activator from reaching the catalyst precursor if Separate addition to the reactor was \\n practiced. This practice leads to extremely efficient utiliza tion of activator and improved polymer product properties. \\n After completion of the mixing of activator with catalyst \\n precursor, direct injection into the reactor occurs. Means of feeding a slurry to a gas phase reactor are well known and described in the art (see European Patent Application 635 521, for example). \\n The hydrocarbon used for the formation of the slurry can \\n be any essentially air and moisture free aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon which is unreactive with the catalyst precursor, \\n the precursor activator compounds, and the cocatalyst. In \\n practice, Since many of the final polymer products find end \\n uses in food packaging, aromatic hydrocarbons would not be a preferred slurry solvent. The hydrocarbon slurry solvent is \\n typically chosen from hydrogenated “mineral oils” or naph \\n thenic oils of relatively high Viscosity to minimize Settling of \\n catalyst Solids in feed tubes and the like, although, with appropriate engineering design, lower Viscosity Solvents \\n Such as isopentane, hexane, and heptane can be used as Slurry Solvents. These are not particularly preferred due to \\n the additional complexity introduced by use of a lower Viscosity and more easily Settled slurry as catalyst. The \\n viscosity of the hydrocarbon slurry solvent, however, is sufficiently low so that the slurry can be conveniently pumped through the pre-activation apparatus and eventually \\n into the polymerization reactor. Preferred Solvents are ali phatic hydrocarbons with viscosity greater than about 50 centipoises (cps), particularly greater than about 100 cps and \\n less than about 5,000 cps. Particularly preferred solvents are \\n napthenic mineral oils typified by materials Such as the Kaydol series of food grade mineral oils supplied by Witco \\n under the trademark Kaydol(R) 350 and 550. \\n It is preferred not to use a Support. However, in those \\n cases where it is desired to Support the precursor, Silica is the preferred Support. Other Suitable Supports are inorganic \\n oxides Such as aluminum phosphate, alumina, Silica/alumina mixtures, Silica modified with an organoaluminum com pound Such as triethylaluminum, and Silica modified with diethyl Zinc. A typical Support is a Solid, particulate, porous \\n material essentially inert to the polymerization. It is used as a dry powder having an average particle Size of about 10 to \\n about 250 microns and preferably about 30 to about 100 15 \\n 25 \\n 35 \\n 40 \\n 45 \\n 50 \\n 55 \\n 60 \\n 65 8 \\n microns, a Surface area of at least 200 Square meters per gram and preferably at least about 250 Square meters per \\n gram; and a pore Size of at least about 100 angstroms and preferably at least about 200 angstroms. Generally, the \\n amount of support used is that which will provide about 0.1 \\n to about 1.0 millimole of titanium per gram of Support and \\n preferably about 0.4 to about 0.9 millimole of titanium per gram of Support. Impregnation of the above mentioned catalyst precursor into a Silica Support can be accomplished \\n by mixing the precursor and Silica gel in the electron donor \\n solvent or other solvent followed by solvent removal under reduced pressure. The resultant Solid catalyst is then con verted into a free flowing Slurry with an aliphatic hydrocar \\n bon as described above Such that it is pumpable as a liquid into the process. Catalyst precursorS Such as those described \\n in U.S. Pat. No. 5,290,745 and European Patent Application 771 820 are particularly useful in the process of subject \\n invention when placed into a hydrocarbon Slurry in the \\n unactivated State. \\n The polymerization is conducted in the gas phase using a \\n continuous fluidized bed process. \\n Melt index is determined under ASTM D-1238, Condition E. It is measured at 190° C. and 2.16 kilograms and reported as grams per 10 minutes or decigrams per minute. Flow \\n index is determined under ASTM D-1238, Condition F. It is \\n measured at 190° C. and 10 times the weight used in determining the melt index, and reported as grams per 10 \\n minutes or decigrams per minute. Melt flow ratio is the ratio \\n of flow index to melt index. The product, as removed from \\n the reactor, can have a melt indeX in the range of about 0.02 to about 300 grams per 10 minutes, and preferably has a melt \\n index in the range of about >0.04 to about 50 grams per 10 \\n minutes. The melt flow ratio is in the range of about 20 to about 50, and is preferably in the range of about 20 to about 30. The density of the polymer is normally at least 0.900 \\n gram per cubic centimeter, and is preferably in the range of \\n 0.915 to 0.960 gram per cubic centimeter. The bulk density \\n can be in the range of about 18 to about 32 pounds per cubic foot, and is preferably greater than 22 pounds per cubic foot. \\n The molecular weight distribution of the polymer is reflected \\n in an Mw/Mn of about 3 to about 7. Mw is the weight average molecular weight, Mn is the number average \\n molecular weight; and the Mw/Mn ratio can be referred to as the polydispersity index, which is a measure of the \\n breadth of the molecular weight distribution. Mw/Mn can \\n also be related to MFR, with lower values of MFR indicated \\n lower values of Mw/Mn and a narrower molecular weight \\n distribution. \\n The transition metal based catalyst System including the activated precursor, ethylene, and, optionally, alpha-olefin \\n and hydrogen are continuously fed into the reactor, and the \\n final product is continuously removed from the reactor. \\n In the reactor: \\n The mole ratio of alpha-olefin (if used) to ethylene can be in the range of about 0.01:1 to about 0.8:1, and is preferably \\n in the range of about 0.02:1 to about 0.35:1. The mole ratio of hydrogen (if used) to ethylene can be in the range of about \\n 0.001:1 to about 2:1, and is preferably in the range of about 0.01 to about 0.5:1. Preferred operating temperatures vary \\n depending on the density desired, i.e., lower temperatures \\n for lower densities and higher temperatures for higher \\n densities. \\n The pressure, i.e., the total pressure in the reactor, can be in the range of about 200 to about 500 psig (pounds per Square inch gauge) and is preferably in the range of about \\n 280 to about 450 psig. The ethylene partial pressure can be \n",

The balance of the total pressure is provided by alpha-olefin (if used) and an \\n inert gas Such as nitrogen. Other inert hydrocarbons, Such as an induced condensing agent e.g., isopentane, hexane also \\n contribute to the overall preSSure in the reactor according to their vapor pressure under the temperature and pressure \\n experienced in the reactor. A typical fluidized bed reactor \\n can be described as follows: \\n The bed is usually made up of the same granular resin that \\n is to be produced in the reactor. Thus, during the course of the polymerization, the bed comprises formed polymer particles, growing polymer particles, and catalyst particles \\n fluidized by polymerization and modifying gaseous compo \\n nents introduced at a flow rate or Velocity Sufficient to cause the particles to Separate and act as a fluid. The fluidizing gas \\n is made up of the initial feed, make-up feed, and cycle \\n (recycle) gas, i.e., comonomers and, if desired, modifiers and/or an inert carrier gas. \\n The essential parts of the reaction System are the vessel, \\n the bed, the gas distribution plate, inlet and outlet piping, a compressor, cycle gas cooler, and a product discharge SyS \\n tem. In the vessel, above the bed, there is a velocity \\n reduction Zone, and, in the bed, a reaction Zone. Both are above the gas distribution plate. \\n A typical fluidized bed reactor is further described in U.S. \\n Pat. No. 4,482,687. \\n The gaseous feed Streams of ethylene, other gaseous alpha-olefins (if used), and hydrogen (if used) are preferably fed to the reactor recycle line as well as liquid alpha-olefins (if used). The activated catalyst precursor is preferably \\n injected into the fluidized bed as a Solid or a mineral oil Slurry. The product composition can be varied by changing \\n the molar ratioS of the comonomers introduced into the \\n fluidized bed. The product is continuously discharged in \\n granular or particulate form from the reactor as the bed level builds up with polymerization. The production rate is con \\n trolled by adjusting the catalyst feed rate and/or the ethylene partial pressures. \\n The hydrogen:ethylene mole ratio can be adjusted to control average molecular weights. The alpha-olefins (other than ethylene) can be present in a total amount of up to 15 percent by weight of the copolymer and, if used, are pref \\n erably included in the copolymer in a total amount of about 1 to about 10 percent by weight based on the weight of the copolymer. \\n The residence time of the mixture of reactants including gaseous and liquid reactants, catalyst, and resin in the \\n fluidized bed can be in the range of about 1 to about 12 hours and is preferably in the range of about 2 to about 5 hours. \\n The reactor can be run in the condensing mode, if desired. \\n The condensing mode is described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,543, \\n 399; 4,588,790; and 5,352,749. \\n The resin can be extruded in a conventional extruder \\n adapted for that purpose. Extruders and processes for extru \\n Sion are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,814, 135; 4,857,600; \\n 5,076,988; and 5,153,382. Examples of various extruders, which can be used in forming film are a single Screw type \\n Such as one modified with a blown film die and air ring and continuous take off equipment, a blown film extruder, and a Slot cast extruder. A typical Single Screw type extruder can be described as one having a hopper at its upstream end and \\n a die at its downstream end. The hopper feeds into a barrel, \\n which contains a Screw. At the downstream end, between the \\n end of the Screw and the die, is a Screen pack and a breaker plate. The screw portion of the extruder is considered to be 15 \\n 25 \\n 35 \\n 40 \\n 45 \\n 50 \\n 55 \\n 60 \\n 65 10 \\n divided up into three Sections, the feed Section, the com pression Section, and the metering Section, and multiple \\n heating Zones from the rear heating Zone to the front heating \\n Zone, the multiple Sections and Zones running from upstream \\n to downstream. If it has more than one barrel, the barrels are \\n connected in Series. The length to diameter ratio of each barrel is in the range of about 16:1 to about 30:1. The extrusion can take place at temperatures in the range of \\n about 160 to about 270 degrees C., and is preferably carried \\n out at temperatures in the range of about 180 to about 240 degrees C. \\n The advantages of the invention are found in that molecu \\n lar weight distribution can be narrowed and hexane extract \\n ables can be decreased without a decrease in hydrogen response and catalyst activity; there is no rapid increase in \\n reaction rate, which can result in sheeting, chunking, and cessation of operation; reduction of the cocatalyst, i.e., activator, requirement; improved proceSS control; the pre \\n cursor is leSS Sensitive to over-reduction; catalyst fines are all active So they are less likely to Segregate and migrate to \\n the reactor wall to form sheets, facilitates activator change where different products are desired; the process allows for \\n complete activation even where the activator has very low (or nil) vapor pressure Such as tri-n-hexyl aluminum; the \\n process allows the use of leSS expensive activatorS Such as triethylaluminum and triusobutylaluminum; eliminates the \\n need for Separate cocatalyst feed; although the proceSS is \\n primarily focused on higher molecular weight (and lower levels of low molecular weight species), narrow molecular weight distribution products for fabrication into film, the process has broader application to higher melt indeX products, typically resins used in injection molding, elimi \\n nates other forms of catalyst premixing, often a unit opera tion; and allows for quick changes of catalyst by changing \\n relative flow rates of precursor and activator. \\n Conventional additives, which can be introduced into the resin product, are exemplified by antioxidants, ultraViolet absorbers, pigments, dyes, nucleating agents, fillers, Slip \\n agents, fire retardants, plasticizers, processing aids, \\n lubricants, Stabilizers, Smoke inhibitors, Viscosity control agents, and crosslinking agents, catalysts, and boosters, \\n tackifiers, and anti-blocking agents. Aside from the fillers, \\n the additives can be present in the blend in amounts of about 0.1 to about 10 parts by weight of additive for each 100 parts \\n by weight of polymer blend. Fillers can be added in amounts up to 200 parts by weight and more for each 100 parts by \\n weight of the blend. \\n Patents, patent applications, and other publications men \\n tioned in this specification are incorporated by reference \\n herein. \\n Molecular weights are weight average molecular weights \\n unless otherwise noted. \\n The invention is illustrated by the following examples. \\n EXAMPLES 1 to 4 \\n Examples 1 to 4 are embodiments of the invention. In these examples, a Small polymerization reaction System, as \\n described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,290,745 and references con \\n tained therein, is used. Instead of manipulating the activator/ \\n electron donor ratioS in an in-line fashion as indicated in the \\n discussion of the preferred mode, the partially activated precursors are prepared in a batch fashion due to the extreme difficulty encountered in metering activator compound flows \\n which would be at rates of about 1 to 3 cubic centimeters per \\n hour. These results are illustrative of the effect of the \\n invention in manipulating polymer properties in an in-line \n",

The mixture is \\n heated to about 60° C. to about 140°C., preferably about 80° \\n C. to about 120° C., until the solvent begins to reflux and the magnesium-halide compound goes into Solution, whereupon \\n the mixture becomes transparent, and the temperature is \\n maintained at the reflux temperature for about 0.25 hours to about 3.0 hours, preferably about 1.0 hour to about 2.0 hours, preferably with continuous stirring. It is possible to \\n form the mixture without either the oil or the Solvent, or by mixing the ingredients in a different order, but the above \\n described mixing operation has been shown to result in a well-dispersed mixture. \\n 0015 The clear mixture, which includes a MgCl2.xEtOH complex (where X is an integer from 1-20), is rapidly transferred to a Second mixing apparatus containing a pre \\n chilled hydrocarbon Solvent, Such as heptane, hexane, cyclo hexane, or other aliphatic or cycloaliphatic hydrocarbon \\n which is miscible in the oil and which will not freeze at the \\n temperatures necessary for the Solidification of the MgCl2.xEtOH complex. The hydrocarbon solvent is pre \\n chilled, for example, to between ice (0° C.) and dry ice/ isopropanol temperatures (i.e., about -70° C. to -90° C.). The rapid temperature decrease causes almost all of the magnesium-halide compound to precipitate out of Solution \\n and crystallize onto the Silica Seeding agent, thus coating the Silica Seeding agent to form a catalyst Support. The catalyst \\n Support particles preferably include less than 10 wt % Silica, \\n preferably no more than 5 wt % silica, and more preferably \\n no more than 3 wt % Silica. \\n 0016. After about 0.5 to 2 hours, preferably about 1 hour, \\n the mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature and it is filtered. Approximately Spherical and/or Spheroidal Solid \\n catalyst Support particles, each comprising at least one Silica Seeding agent with magnesium-halide crystals attached \\n thereto, are collected and washed Several times with more hydrocarbon Solvent, until the hydrocarbon Solvent appears \\n to be colorless, and are dried (e.g., vacuum dried) in a rotary evaporator at about 40 C. to 80 C., preferably at about 60 \\n C., for 1 to 3 hours, preferably for about 2 hours. The term “approximately Spherical' or “approximately Spheroidal' \\n means that all points on the Surface of the particle are within \\n the range of radius r to 2r wherein r is the minimum radial \\n distance between the center of the particle and the closest Mar. 2, 2006 \\n point thereto on the Surface of the particle. The magnesium halide compound may alternately be crystallized onto the \\n Silica Seeding agent with known Spray drying techniqueS or \\n by gradually evaporating the Solvent in which it was origi \\n nally dissolved. \\n 0017 Next, the catalyst support is slowly added to about \\n 10 to 50 moles of a transition metal compound for each mole of magnesium in the magnesium-halide compound at about \\n -30 to 50 C., and the temperature of this mixture is raised \\n to about 20 to 80°C., preferably about 30-60° C. An internal electron donor is added and the temperature is raised, generally with stirring, to about 80 to 130 C., preferably \\n 100-110° C., and is kept at that level for about 1 to 3 hours, preferably about 2 hours. \\n 0018. The internal electron donor compound, in general, \\n is used in an amount from about 0.05 to about 2.0 moles, \\n preferably about 0.1 to about 0.5 mole, for each mole of magnesium in the magnesium-halide compound. \\n 0019. The result is a mixture comprising solid catalyst \\n particles and unreacted transition metal compound and inter \\n nal electron donor compound. \\n 0020. The solid catalyst particles are filtered out and, \\n preferably, extracted for about 1 to 3 hours, preferably about \\n 2 hours, at about 110 to 140 C., more preferably about 125 C. with a mixture of transition metal compound (about 5 to 30 wt %, preferably about 10 wt %), and an inert solvent, Such as a C-C alkylbenzene, preferably ethylbenzene \\n (about 70 to 85 wt %, preferably about 90 wt %) in a known “Soxhlet” extraction type arrangement. This extraction treat ment enhances catalyst activity and Stereospecificity. Alter \\n natively, the Solid catalyst may receive any number of other \\n known extraction treatments, which may, but need not, include a transition metal treatment. Alternatively, the cata lyst could simply be boiled in a Solution comprising a \\n transition metal compound with or without an inert Solvent, \\n i.e., a Solvent which will not react with the transition metal \\n compound. U.S. Pat. No. 4,745,164 to Schweier et al. and \\n U.S. Pat. No. 6,034,023 to Kersting et al., which are incor porated by reference herein, teach examples of extraction \\n methods which may be utilized in the present invention. \\n 0021. The Solid catalyst may be recovered by filtration, \\n washed with an inert Solvent, Such as heptane, hexane, cyclohexane or other aliphatic or cycloaliphatic hydrocar \\n bon, dried by draining off transition metal compound and \\n Solvent, washed a Second time with the inert Solvent, and \\n dried. \\n 0022. The solid catalyst Support particles and/or catalyst \\n particles preferably comprise about 0.01 wt % to about 10 wt \\n % silica, more preferably about 0.1 wt % to about 5 wt % \\n Silica. \\n 0023 The solid catalyst Support particles and/or catalyst particles preferably have a weight percent ratio of Silica to \\n magnesium-halide compound in the range of about 1:20 to \\n 1:3, preferably from about 1:10 to 1:4. \\n 0024. The catalyst may preferably be treated with an organo-aluminum co-catalyst and an external electron donor or other Stereoregulating agent to form a Ziegler-Natta \\n catalyst, which may be used, for example, in polymerization \\n reactions.

The slurry is then contacted with the aforementioned organomagnesium composi \\n tion, while the heating is continued at the aforemen tioned temperature. The organomagnesium composition has the empirical \\n formula Rin Mg R\", where R and R' are the same or different C4-C12 alkyl groups, preferably C4-C10 alkyl groups, more preferably C4-C8 unsubstituted alkyl groups, and most preferably both R and R' are n-butyl groups, and m and n are each 0, 1 or 2, providing that m-n is equal to the valence of Mg. Suitable non-polar solvents are materials in which all of the reactants used herein, i.e., the organomagnesium composition, the compound of formula (II) and the transition metal compounds are at least partially soluble and which are liquid at reaction temperatures. Preferred non-polar solvents are alkanes, such as hexane, n-hep tane, octane, nonane, and decane, although a variety of other materials including cycloalkanes, such as cyclo \\n hexane, aromatics, such as benzene and ethylbenzene can be employed. The most preferred non-polar solvent \\n is hexane. Prior to use, the non-polar solvent should be purified, such as by percolation through silica gel and \\n /or molecular sieves, to remove traces of water, oxy gen, polar compounds, and other materials capable of adversely affecting catalyst activity. \\n In the most preferred embodiment of the synthesis of this catalyst it is important to add only such an amount of the organomagnesium composition that will be deposited-physically or chemically--onto the support since any excess of the organomagnesium composition \\n in the solution may react with other synthesis chemi cals, and precipitate outside of the support. The carrier drying temperature affects the number of sites on the carrier available for the organomagnesium composi tion-the higher the drying temperature the lower the \\n number of sites. Thus, the exact molar ratio of the or ganomagnesium composition to the hydroxyl groups \\n will vary and must be determined on a case-by-case basis to assure that only so much of the ogranomag nesium composition is added to the solution as will be deposited onto the support without leaving any excess of the organomagnesium composition in the solution. \\n Furthermore, it is believed that the molar amout of the organomagnesium composition deposited onto the sup port is greater than the molar content of the hydroxyl groups on the support. Thus, the molar ratios given below are intended to serve only as an approximate guideline and the exact amount of the organomag nesium composition in this embodiment must be con trolled by the functional limitation discussed above, i.e., it must not be greater than that which can be deposited onto the support. If greater than the amount is added to the solvent, the excess may react with the compound of formula (II), thereby forming a precipitate outside of the support which is detrimental in the synthesis of our catalyst and must be avoided. The amount of the or ganomagnesium composition which is not greater than that deposited onto the support can be determined in any conventional manner, e.g., by adding the or ganomagnesium composition to the slurry of the carrier in the solvent, while stirring the slurry, until the or ganomagnesium composition is detected as a solution in \\n the solvent. \\n For example, for the silica carrier heated at about 200 to about 850 C., the amount of the organomag O \\n 15 \\n 20 \\n 25 \\n 30 \\n 35 \\n 45 \\n 50 \\n 55 \\n 60 \\n 65 6 \\n nesium composition added to the slurry is such that the molar ratio of Mg to the hydroxyl groups (OH) on the \\n solid carrier is about 1:1 to about 6:1, preferably about 2:1 to about 4:1, more preferably about 2.5:1 to about 3.5:1 and most preferably about 3:1, depending upon the \\n temperature at which the carrier material was dried. The organomagnesium composition dissolves in the \\n non-polar solvent to form a solution. \\n It is also possible to add such an amount of the or ganomagnesium composition which is in excess of that \\n which will be deposited onto the support and then re move, e.g., by filtration and washing, any excess of the organomagnesium composition. However, this alterna \\n tive is less desirable than the most preferred embodi \\n ment described above. \\n After the addition of the organomagnesium composi tion to the slurry is completed, the slurry is contacted \\n with at least one compound of the formula (II) \\n R'-OH (II) \\n where R' is a C1-C10 alkyl group or a C1-C10 haloge nated alkyl group, preferably R' is a C1-C10 alkyl \\n group, more preferably a C1-C4 normal alkyl group or a C1-C4 halogenated normal alkyl group, and most preferably R' is an ethyl group. Thus, the compound of \\n formula (II) is preferably an alcohol and most prefera bly ethanol. The amount of the compound of formula (II) used in this synthesis step is sufficient to convert substantially all of the magnesium alkyl (Mg-R or \\n MgR) groups on the carrier to magnesium alkoxy \\n (MgO R') groups. In a preferred embodiment, the \\n amount of the formula (II) compound added is such that substantially no excess thereof is present in the non polar solvent after substantially all of the magnesium alkyl groups are converted to the magnesium alkoxy \\n groups on the carrier to prevent the reaction of the \\n formula (II) compound with the transition metal com pound outside of the carrier. This synthesis step is con ducted at about 25 to about 65° C., preferably at about 30 to about 55 C., and most preferably at about 30 to \\n about 40 C. \\n After the addition of the formula (II) compound is completed, the slurry is contacted with at least one transition metal compound soluble in the non-polar solvent. This synthesis step is conducted at about 25 to about 65° C., preferably at about 30 to about 55 C., and most preferably at about 30 to about 40° C. In a preferred embodiment, the amount of the transition metal compound added is not greater than that which \\n can be deposited onto the carrier. The exact molar ratio \\n of Mg to the transition metal and of the transition metal to the hydroxyl groups of the carrier will therefore vary (depending, e.g., on the carrier drying temperature) and \\n must be determined on a case-by-case basis. For exam \\n ple, for the silica carrier heated at about 200 to 850 C., the amount of the transition metal compound is such that the molar ratio of the transition metal, derived from the transition metal compound, to the hydroxyl groups of the carrier is about 1 to about 2.0, preferably about 1.5 to about 2.0 and the molar ratio of Mg to the transi tion metal is about 1 to about 3, preferably about 2 to about 3. We found that these molar ratios produce a catalyst composition which produces resins having \\n relatively low melt flow ratio (MFR) values of about 20 \\n to about 35. As is known to those skilled in the art, such resins can be utilized to produce high strength films and \n",

The temperature of the Solid Suspension halogenation ranges from room tem perature to the boiling point of the aliphatic hydrocarbon \\n used as solvent, preferably at 60° C. \\n 0075 According to the present invention, in step (g) of \\n the process, the solid obtained in (f) is kept under higher temperature that depends on the inert organic solvent used. \\n 0076. The time necessary for this thermal treatment of the \\n solid obtained in step (f) ranges from 0.5 hour to 5 hours, preferably from 3 to 5 hours. The ideal temperature for this \\n purpose depends on the organic solvent used and it can be \\n conducted from 60° C. to 120° C., preferably from 60° C. to \\n 75° C., when hexane is used as the organic solvent. \\n 0077. At the step (h) after the thermal treatment, the solid can be separated from the Suspension, for example by \\n settling and siphoning, filtration or centrifugation, washed \\n with an inert organic solvent, preferably hexane, and then dried. The washing temperature can vary from room tem perature to the boiling point of the aliphatic hydrocarbon \\n used as solvent, preferably at room temperature. \\n 0078. Optionally, the solid obtained in (h) is washed with a solution of organometallic compounds of the groups 1, 2, \\n 12 or 13. More specifically, in the optional step (i) the solid \\n obtained in step (h) is suspended in an inert organic solvent \\n Such as hexane or heptane, and it is put in contact with one \n",

The impeller promotes Some radial mixing, but mainly assures that the bottom Section of the residence time pot does not experience SuS pended solid buildup. \\n After activator has been added to the catalyst precursor Slurry in one or two steps, additional activator is added as a last step prior to entry into the reactor. Preferably, this \\n addition occurs within 30 minutes and preferably within less than 15 minutes of actual injection of the catalyst precursor \\n Slurry into the reactor. The activator can be in Solution in an inert Solvent (Such as a high Viscosity fluid carrier or a lower Viscosity Solvent) or added as pure component. It is essential \\n that a mixer, preferably an additional Static mixer element, be located immediately downstream of the addition point of \\n the additional activator. It is also important to keep the Slurry flowing to assure that no plugs form in the catalyst feed line. \\n Additional activator is fed to provide for sufficient activation of the catalyst plus a Small additional amount to Scavenge \\n impurities in the polymerization reactor. The total amount of \\n this additional “topping off activator can be about 0.1 to \\n about 75 percent by mol of the total amount of the activator \\n used for the activation of the precursor. Addition of all of the activator to the catalyst precursor eliminates mass transfer problems, which would prevent the activator from reaching the catalyst precursor if Separate addition to the reactor was \\n practiced. This practice leads to extremely efficient utiliza tion of activator and improved polymer product properties. \\n After completion of the mixing of activator with catalyst \\n precursor, direct injection into the reactor occurs. Means of feeding a slurry to a gas phase reactor are well known and described in the art (see European Patent Application 635 521, for example). \\n The hydrocarbon used for the formation of the slurry can \\n be any essentially air and moisture free aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon which is unreactive with the catalyst precursor, \\n the precursor activator compounds, and the cocatalyst. In \\n practice, Since many of the final polymer products find end \\n uses in food packaging, aromatic hydrocarbons would not be a preferred slurry solvent. The hydrocarbon slurry solvent is \\n typically chosen from hydrogenated “mineral oils” or naph \\n thenic oils of relatively high Viscosity to minimize Settling of \\n catalyst Solids in feed tubes and the like, although, with appropriate engineering design, lower Viscosity Solvents \\n Such as isopentane, hexane, and heptane can be used as Slurry Solvents. These are not particularly preferred due to \\n the additional complexity introduced by use of a lower Viscosity and more easily Settled slurry as catalyst. The \\n viscosity of the hydrocarbon slurry solvent, however, is sufficiently low so that the slurry can be conveniently pumped through the pre-activation apparatus and eventually \\n into the polymerization reactor. Preferred Solvents are ali phatic hydrocarbons with viscosity greater than about 50 centipoises (cps), particularly greater than about 100 cps and \\n less than about 5,000 cps. Particularly preferred solvents are \\n napthenic mineral oils typified by materials Such as the Kaydol series of food grade mineral oils supplied by Witco \\n under the trademark Kaydol(R) 350 and 550. \\n It is preferred not to use a Support. However, in those \\n cases where it is desired to Support the precursor, Silica is the preferred Support. Other Suitable Supports are inorganic \\n oxides Such as aluminum phosphate, alumina, Silica/alumina mixtures, Silica modified with an organoaluminum com pound Such as triethylaluminum, and Silica modified with diethyl Zinc. A typical Support is a Solid, particulate, porous \\n material essentially inert to the polymerization. It is used as a dry powder having an average particle Size of about 10 to \\n about 250 microns and preferably about 30 to about 100 15 \\n 25 \\n 35 \\n 40 \\n 45 \\n 50 \\n 55 \\n 60 \\n 65 8 \\n microns, a Surface area of at least 200 Square meters per gram and preferably at least about 250 Square meters per \\n gram; and a pore Size of at least about 100 angstroms and preferably at least about 200 angstroms. Generally, the \\n amount of support used is that which will provide about 0.1 \\n to about 1.0 millimole of titanium per gram of Support and \\n preferably about 0.4 to about 0.9 millimole of titanium per gram of Support. Impregnation of the above mentioned catalyst precursor into a Silica Support can be accomplished \\n by mixing the precursor and Silica gel in the electron donor \\n solvent or other solvent followed by solvent removal under reduced pressure. The resultant Solid catalyst is then con verted into a free flowing Slurry with an aliphatic hydrocar \\n bon as described above Such that it is pumpable as a liquid into the process. Catalyst precursorS Such as those described \\n in U.S. Pat. No. 5,290,745 and European Patent Application 771 820 are particularly useful in the process of subject \\n invention when placed into a hydrocarbon Slurry in the \\n unactivated State. \\n The polymerization is conducted in the gas phase using a \\n continuous fluidized bed process. \\n Melt index is determined under ASTM D-1238, Condition E. It is measured at 190° C. and 2.16 kilograms and reported as grams per 10 minutes or decigrams per minute. Flow \\n index is determined under ASTM D-1238, Condition F. It is \\n measured at 190° C. and 10 times the weight used in determining the melt index, and reported as grams per 10 \\n minutes or decigrams per minute. Melt flow ratio is the ratio \\n of flow index to melt index. The product, as removed from \\n the reactor, can have a melt indeX in the range of about 0.02 to about 300 grams per 10 minutes, and preferably has a melt \\n index in the range of about >0.04 to about 50 grams per 10 \\n minutes. The melt flow ratio is in the range of about 20 to about 50, and is preferably in the range of about 20 to about 30. The density of the polymer is normally at least 0.900 \\n gram per cubic centimeter, and is preferably in the range of \\n 0.915 to 0.960 gram per cubic centimeter. The bulk density \\n can be in the range of about 18 to about 32 pounds per cubic foot, and is preferably greater than 22 pounds per cubic foot. \\n The molecular weight distribution of the polymer is reflected \\n in an Mw/Mn of about 3 to about 7. Mw is the weight average molecular weight, Mn is the number average \\n molecular weight; and the Mw/Mn ratio can be referred to as the polydispersity index, which is a measure of the \\n breadth of the molecular weight distribution. Mw/Mn can \\n also be related to MFR, with lower values of MFR indicated \\n lower values of Mw/Mn and a narrower molecular weight \\n distribution. \\n The transition metal based catalyst System including the activated precursor, ethylene, and, optionally, alpha-olefin \\n and hydrogen are continuously fed into the reactor, and the \\n final product is continuously removed from the reactor. \\n In the reactor: \\n The mole ratio of alpha-olefin (if used) to ethylene can be in the range of about 0.01:1 to about 0.8:1, and is preferably \\n in the range of about 0.02:1 to about 0.35:1. The mole ratio of hydrogen (if used) to ethylene can be in the range of about \\n 0.001:1 to about 2:1, and is preferably in the range of about 0.01 to about 0.5:1. Preferred operating temperatures vary \\n depending on the density desired, i.e., lower temperatures \\n for lower densities and higher temperatures for higher \\n densities. \\n The pressure, i.e., the total pressure in the reactor, can be in the range of about 200 to about 500 psig (pounds per Square inch gauge) and is preferably in the range of about \\n 280 to about 450 psig.

The balance of the total pressure is provided by alpha-olefin (if used) and an \\n inert gas Such as nitrogen. Other inert hydrocarbons, Such as an induced condensing agent e.g., isopentane, hexane also \\n contribute to the overall preSSure in the reactor according to their vapor pressure under the temperature and pressure \\n experienced in the reactor. A typical fluidized bed reactor \\n can be described as follows: \\n The bed is usually made up of the same granular resin that \\n is to be produced in the reactor. Thus, during the course of the polymerization, the bed comprises formed polymer particles, growing polymer particles, and catalyst particles \\n fluidized by polymerization and modifying gaseous compo \\n nents introduced at a flow rate or Velocity Sufficient to cause the particles to Separate and act as a fluid. The fluidizing gas \\n is made up of the initial feed, make-up feed, and cycle \\n (recycle) gas, i.e., comonomers and, if desired, modifiers and/or an inert carrier gas. \\n The essential parts of the reaction System are the vessel, \\n the bed, the gas distribution plate, inlet and outlet piping, a compressor, cycle gas cooler, and a product discharge SyS \\n tem. In the vessel, above the bed, there is a velocity \\n reduction Zone, and, in the bed, a reaction Zone. Both are above the gas distribution plate. \\n A typical fluidized bed reactor is further described in U.S. \\n Pat. No. 4,482,687. \\n The gaseous feed Streams of ethylene, other gaseous alpha-olefins (if used), and hydrogen (if used) are preferably fed to the reactor recycle line as well as liquid alpha-olefins (if used). The activated catalyst precursor is preferably \\n injected into the fluidized bed as a Solid or a mineral oil Slurry. The product composition can be varied by changing \\n the molar ratioS of the comonomers introduced into the \\n fluidized bed. The product is continuously discharged in \\n granular or particulate form from the reactor as the bed level builds up with polymerization. The production rate is con \\n trolled by adjusting the catalyst feed rate and/or the ethylene partial pressures. \\n The hydrogen:ethylene mole ratio can be adjusted to control average molecular weights. The alpha-olefins (other than ethylene) can be present in a total amount of up to 15 percent by weight of the copolymer and, if used, are pref \\n erably included in the copolymer in a total amount of about 1 to about 10 percent by weight based on the weight of the copolymer. \\n The residence time of the mixture of reactants including gaseous and liquid reactants, catalyst, and resin in the \\n fluidized bed can be in the range of about 1 to about 12 hours and is preferably in the range of about 2 to about 5 hours. \\n The reactor can be run in the condensing mode, if desired. \\n The condensing mode is described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,543, \\n 399; 4,588,790; and 5,352,749. \\n The resin can be extruded in a conventional extruder \\n adapted for that purpose. Extruders and processes for extru \\n Sion are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,814, 135; 4,857,600; \\n 5,076,988; and 5,153,382. Examples of various extruders, which can be used in forming film are a single Screw type \\n Such as one modified with a blown film die and air ring and continuous take off equipment, a blown film extruder, and a Slot cast extruder. A typical Single Screw type extruder can be described as one having a hopper at its upstream end and \\n a die at its downstream end. The hopper feeds into a barrel, \\n which contains a Screw. At the downstream end, between the \\n end of the Screw and the die, is a Screen pack and a breaker plate. The screw portion of the extruder is considered to be 15 \\n 25 \\n 35 \\n 40 \\n 45 \\n 50 \\n 55 \\n 60 \\n 65 10 \\n divided up into three Sections, the feed Section, the com pression Section, and the metering Section, and multiple \\n heating Zones from the rear heating Zone to the front heating \\n Zone, the multiple Sections and Zones running from upstream \\n to downstream. If it has more than one barrel, the barrels are \\n connected in Series. The length to diameter ratio of each barrel is in the range of about 16:1 to about 30:1. The extrusion can take place at temperatures in the range of \\n about 160 to about 270 degrees C., and is preferably carried \\n out at temperatures in the range of about 180 to about 240 degrees C. \\n The advantages of the invention are found in that molecu \\n lar weight distribution can be narrowed and hexane extract \\n ables can be decreased without a decrease in hydrogen response and catalyst activity; there is no rapid increase in \\n reaction rate, which can result in sheeting, chunking, and cessation of operation; reduction of the cocatalyst, i.e., activator, requirement; improved proceSS control; the pre \\n cursor is leSS Sensitive to over-reduction; catalyst fines are all active So they are less likely to Segregate and migrate to \\n the reactor wall to form sheets, facilitates activator change where different products are desired; the process allows for \\n complete activation even where the activator has very low (or nil) vapor pressure Such as tri-n-hexyl aluminum; the \\n process allows the use of leSS expensive activatorS Such as triethylaluminum and triusobutylaluminum; eliminates the \\n need for Separate cocatalyst feed; although the proceSS is \\n primarily focused on higher molecular weight (and lower levels of low molecular weight species), narrow molecular weight distribution products for fabrication into film, the process has broader application to higher melt indeX products, typically resins used in injection molding, elimi \\n nates other forms of catalyst premixing, often a unit opera tion; and allows for quick changes of catalyst by changing \\n relative flow rates of precursor and activator. \\n Conventional additives, which can be introduced into the resin product, are exemplified by antioxidants, ultraViolet absorbers, pigments, dyes, nucleating agents, fillers, Slip \\n agents, fire retardants, plasticizers, processing aids, \\n lubricants, Stabilizers, Smoke inhibitors, Viscosity control agents, and crosslinking agents, catalysts, and boosters, \\n tackifiers, and anti-blocking agents. Aside from the fillers, \\n the additives can be present in the blend in amounts of about 0.1 to about 10 parts by weight of additive for each 100 parts \\n by weight of polymer blend. Fillers can be added in amounts up to 200 parts by weight and more for each 100 parts by \\n weight of the blend. \\n Patents, patent applications, and other publications men \\n tioned in this specification are incorporated by reference \\n herein. \\n Molecular weights are weight average molecular weights \\n unless otherwise noted. \\n The invention is illustrated by the following examples. \\n EXAMPLES 1 to 4 \\n Examples 1 to 4 are embodiments of the invention. In these examples, a Small polymerization reaction System, as \\n described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,290,745 and references con \\n tained therein, is used. Instead of manipulating the activator/ \\n electron donor ratioS in an in-line fashion as indicated in the \\n discussion of the preferred mode, the partially activated precursors are prepared in a batch fashion due to the extreme difficulty encountered in metering activator compound flows \\n which would be at rates of about 1 to 3 cubic centimeters per \\n hour. These results are illustrative of the effect of the \\n invention in manipulating polymer properties in an in-line \n",

The flow index (I 21.6) can be in the range of about 0.20 to about 5.0 grams per 10 minutes, and is preferably in the range of about 0.25 to about 4 grams per 10 minutes. The molecular weight of this polymer is, generally, in the range of about 250,000 to about 600,000. The density of the copolymer can be in the range of 0.890 to 0.940 gram per cubic centimeter, and is preferably in the range of 0.900 to 0.935 gram per cubic centimeter. The melt flow ratio (I 21.6/I 2.16) of the polymer can be in the range of about 20 to about 65, and is preferably about 22 to about \\n 50. \\n Melt index (I 2.16) is determined under ASTM D-1238, Condition E. It is measured at 190° C. and 2.16 kilograms and reported as grams per 10 minutes. Melt index (I 5) can also be determined under ASTM D-1238, Condition P. It is measured at 190° C. and 5 kilograms and reported as grams per 10 minutes. Flow index (I 21.6) is determined under ASTM D-1238, Condition F. It is measured at 190° C. and 21.6 kilograms and reported as grams per 10 minutes. Melt \\n flow ratio is the ratio of flow index (I 21.6) to melt index (I 2.16 or I 5). \\n In the low molecular weight (LMW) reactor: \\n A relatively high melt index (I 2.16) (or low molecular weight) copolymer is prepared in this reactor. The high melt index can be in the range of about 80 to about 1000 grams per 10 minutes, and is preferably in the range of about 150 to about 900 grams per 10 minutes. The molecular weight of the high melt indeX copolymer is, generally, in the range of about 15,000 to about 35,000. The density of the copolymer prepared in this reactor can be in the range of 0.925 to 0.970 gram per cubic centimeter, and is preferably in the range of \\n 0.928 to 0.965 gram per cubic centimeter. The melt flow ratio (I 21.6/I 2.16) of this copolymer can be in the range of about 20 to about 65, and is preferably about 22 to about 50. \\n The blend or final product, as removed from the second reactor, can have a melt index (I5) in the range of about 0.01 to about 2.0 grams per 10 minutes, and preferably has a melt index in the range of about 0.05 to about 1.0 grams per 10 minutes. The melt flow ratio (I 21.6/I 5) is in the range of about 20 to about 45, and is preferably in the range of about 22 to about 42. The average molecular weight of the final product is, generally, in the range of about 200,000 to about \\n 350,000. The density of the blend can be in the range of 0.915 to 0.958 gram per cubic centimeter, and is preferably in the range of 0.920 to 0.955 gram per cubic centimeter. \\n The blend has a broad molecular weight distribution \\n which can be characterized as bimodal. The broad molecular \\n weight distribution is reflected in an Mw/Mn ratio of about 18 to about 32, preferably about 20 to about 30. Mw is the weight average molecular weight, Mn is the number average \\n molecular weight; and the Mw/Mn ratio can be referred to as the polydispersity index (PDI), which can be viewed as a measure of the breadth of the molecular weight distribution. \\n The weight ratio of copolymer prepared in the high molecular weight reactor to copolymer prepared in the low \\n molecular weight reactor can be in the range of about 0.8:1 to about 2.3:1, and is preferably in the range of about 0.9:1 to about 1.9:1. The optimum weight ratio is about 1.2:1 to about 1.5:1. This is also known as the split. The magnesium/titanium based catalyst System, ethylene, alpha-olefin, and hydrogen are continuously fed into the first reactor; the polymer/catalyst mixture is continuously trans \\n ferred from the first reactor to the Second reactor; ethylene, alpha-olefin, and hydrogen, as well as cocatalyst are con 15 \\n 25 \\n 35 \\n 40 \\n 45 \\n 50 \\n 55 \\n 60 \\n 65 8 \\n tinuously fed to the Second reactor. The final product is continuously removed from the Second reactor. \\n In the low melt index, as reflected in flow index reactor, i.e., the first reactor: The mole ratio of alpha-olefin to ethylene can be in the range of about 0.005:1 to about 0.4:1, and is preferably in the range of about 0.02:1 to about 0.26:1. The mole ratio of hydrogen to ethylene can be in the range \\n of about 0.0001:1 to about 0.3:1, and is preferably in the range of about 0.001:1 to about 0.18:1. The operating temperature is generally in the range of about 60° C. to about 100° C. Preferred operating temperatures vary depending on \\n the density desired, i.e., lower temperatures for lower den Sities and higher temperatures for higher densities. \\n In the high melt indeX reactor, i.e., the Second reactor: The mole ratio of alpha-olefin (optional) to ethylene can \\n be in the range of about 0.005:1 to about 0.6:1, and is preferably in the range of about 0.01:1 to about 0.42:1. The mole ratio of hydrogen to ethylene can be in the range of \\n about 1.0:1 to about 3:1, and is preferably in the range of about 1.3:1 to about 2.2:1. The operating temperature is generally in the range of about 70° C. to about 110° C. As mentioned above, the temperature is preferably varied with the desired density. \\n The total reactor pressure in the Second reactor is usually higher than that used in the first reactor because of higher ethylene partial pressures and high hydrogen/ethylene \\n requirements. The pressure, i.e., the total pressure in each \\n reactor, can be in the range of about 200 to about 450 psig and is preferably in the range of about 280 to about 400 psig. The ethylene partial pressure in the first reactor can be in the range of about 10 to about 100 psi and is preferably in the range of about 20 to about 60 psi. The ethylene partial \\n preSSure in the Second reactor can be in the range of about 50 to about 120 psi and is preferably in the range of about 60 to about 110 psi. The upper limit of ethylene partial preSSure in the first reactor and the ethylene partial preSSure \\n in the Second reactor are Set according to the amount of copolymer it is desired to produce in each of these reactors, \\n i.e., to achieve the Split mentioned above. It is noted that increasing the ethylene partial pressure in the first reactor \\n leads to an increase in ethylene partial pressure in the Second reactor. Generally, the ethylene partial preSSure roughly \\n doubles in the second reactor over the first reactor. The \\n balance of the total preSSure is provided by alpha-olefin \\n other than ethylene and an inert gas Such as nitrogen. \\n A typical fluidized bed reactor can be described as fol \\n lows: \\n The bed is usually made up of the same granular resin that is to be produced in the reactor.

The solvent is added in amounts from about 2 to 20 times, preferably about 6 times, the molar ratio of the magnesium-halide compound to facilitate the liquefying of \\n the magnesium-halide compound at a lower temperature. \\n U.S. Pat. No. 4,421,674 to Invernizzi et al. teaches, for \\n example, that when the mole ratio of ethanol (“EtOH') to MgCl, is 102, the complex liquefies at 60° C.; at a mole ratio of EtOH to MgCl2 of 7.75 the complex liquefies at 80° C.; \\n at a mole ratio of EtOH to MgCl, of 6.51 the complex liquefies at 90° C.; and at a mole ratio of EtOH to MgCl, of 5.43 the complex liquefies at 100° C. The mixture is initially translucent due to the Suspension of the magnesium-halide \\n compound and the Silica Seeding agent. The mixture is \\n heated to about 60° C. to about 140°C., preferably about 80° \\n C. to about 120° C., until the solvent begins to reflux and the magnesium-halide compound goes into Solution, whereupon \\n the mixture becomes transparent, and the temperature is \\n maintained at the reflux temperature for about 0.25 hours to about 3.0 hours, preferably about 1.0 hour to about 2.0 hours, preferably with continuous stirring. It is possible to \\n form the mixture without either the oil or the Solvent, or by mixing the ingredients in a different order, but the above \\n described mixing operation has been shown to result in a well-dispersed mixture. \\n 0015 The clear mixture, which includes a MgCl2.xEtOH complex (where X is an integer from 1-20), is rapidly transferred to a Second mixing apparatus containing a pre \\n chilled hydrocarbon Solvent, Such as heptane, hexane, cyclo hexane, or other aliphatic or cycloaliphatic hydrocarbon \\n which is miscible in the oil and which will not freeze at the \\n temperatures necessary for the Solidification of the MgCl2.xEtOH complex. The hydrocarbon solvent is pre \\n chilled, for example, to between ice (0° C.) and dry ice/ isopropanol temperatures (i.e., about -70° C. to -90° C.). The rapid temperature decrease causes almost all of the magnesium-halide compound to precipitate out of Solution \\n and crystallize onto the Silica Seeding agent, thus coating the Silica Seeding agent to form a catalyst Support. The catalyst \\n Support particles preferably include less than 10 wt % Silica, \\n preferably no more than 5 wt % silica, and more preferably \\n no more than 3 wt % Silica. \\n 0016. After about 0.5 to 2 hours, preferably about 1 hour, \\n the mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature and it is filtered. Approximately Spherical and/or Spheroidal Solid \\n catalyst Support particles, each comprising at least one Silica Seeding agent with magnesium-halide crystals attached \\n thereto, are collected and washed Several times with more hydrocarbon Solvent, until the hydrocarbon Solvent appears \\n to be colorless, and are dried (e.g., vacuum dried) in a rotary evaporator at about 40 C. to 80 C., preferably at about 60 \\n C., for 1 to 3 hours, preferably for about 2 hours. The term “approximately Spherical' or “approximately Spheroidal' \\n means that all points on the Surface of the particle are within \\n the range of radius r to 2r wherein r is the minimum radial \\n distance between the center of the particle and the closest Mar. 2, 2006 \\n point thereto on the Surface of the particle. The magnesium halide compound may alternately be crystallized onto the \\n Silica Seeding agent with known Spray drying techniqueS or \\n by gradually evaporating the Solvent in which it was origi \\n nally dissolved. \\n 0017 Next, the catalyst support is slowly added to about \\n 10 to 50 moles of a transition metal compound for each mole of magnesium in the magnesium-halide compound at about \\n -30 to 50 C., and the temperature of this mixture is raised \\n to about 20 to 80°C., preferably about 30-60° C. An internal electron donor is added and the temperature is raised, generally with stirring, to about 80 to 130 C., preferably \\n 100-110° C., and is kept at that level for about 1 to 3 hours, preferably about 2 hours. \\n 0018. The internal electron donor compound, in general, \\n is used in an amount from about 0.05 to about 2.0 moles, \\n preferably about 0.1 to about 0.5 mole, for each mole of magnesium in the magnesium-halide compound. \\n 0019. The result is a mixture comprising solid catalyst \\n particles and unreacted transition metal compound and inter \\n nal electron donor compound. \\n 0020. The solid catalyst particles are filtered out and, \\n preferably, extracted for about 1 to 3 hours, preferably about \\n 2 hours, at about 110 to 140 C., more preferably about 125 C. with a mixture of transition metal compound (about 5 to 30 wt %, preferably about 10 wt %), and an inert solvent, Such as a C-C alkylbenzene, preferably ethylbenzene \\n (about 70 to 85 wt %, preferably about 90 wt %) in a known “Soxhlet” extraction type arrangement. This extraction treat ment enhances catalyst activity and Stereospecificity. Alter \\n natively, the Solid catalyst may receive any number of other \\n known extraction treatments, which may, but need not, include a transition metal treatment. Alternatively, the cata lyst could simply be boiled in a Solution comprising a \\n transition metal compound with or without an inert Solvent, \\n i.e., a Solvent which will not react with the transition metal \\n compound.

No. 6,034,023 to Kersting et al., which are incor porated by reference herein, teach examples of extraction \\n methods which may be utilized in the present invention. \\n 0021.

More particularly, when ethylmagnesium chloride is precipi tated from a hexane/tetrahydrofuran solution, each mole of ethylmagnesium chloride precipitated may be complexed with approximately one mole of tetrahydro furan. In more general terms, when an organomag nesium composition is precipitated from a solution con taining an ether, the resulting precipitate may have molecules of this ether complexed with molecules of the organomagnesium composition. The amount of magnesium composition which is impregnated onto the carrier should be sufficient to react with tetravalent titanium in order to incorporate a catalytically effective amount of titanium on the carrier in the manner set forth hereinbelow. More particularly, for example, from about 0.1 to about 5 or even 50 mmoles of magnesium may be impregnated per gram of carrier initially present. When a liquid containing an organomagnesium composition is contacted with a car rier the amount of magnesium in this liquid in terms of mmoles may be essentially the same as that stated above with respect to that which is impregnated onto the \\n carrier. \\n When a non-Lewis base co-solvent is used to slurry the carrier, an amount of such co-solvent sufficient to slurry such carrier may be used. More particularly, for \\n example, from about 2 to about 100 mls of such co-sol vent may be present per gram of carrier. A preferred \\n narrower range would be from about 5 to about 15 mls of co-solvent per gram of carrier. The amount and concentration of organomagnesi um/ether solution which is added to the co-solvent/car rier slurry are preferably sufficient to assure that the organomagnesium composition is at least partially solu \\n ble in the co-solvent/solvent system. Thus, this amount is dependent upon many factors such as the composition of solvents and organomagnesium, the temperature of \\n the co-solvent/solvent system, etc. However, it will be readily understood that the selection of proper amounts and concentrations of organomagnesium/ether solu tions is well within the ability of those of ordinary skill in the art. More particularly, for example, when an ethylmagnesium chloride/tetrahydrofuran solution is \\n added to a hexane/carrier slurry, the concentration of the ethylmagnesium chloride/tetrahydrofuran solution \\n may be from about 0.1 to about 10 Molar. A preferred narrower range would be from about 1 to about 3 Mo \\n lar. For example, when 107 g of silicic acid are suspended in 500 ml of n-heptane and 342 ml of a solution of 172 mmols of n-propyl magnesium chloride in diethyl ether are added thereto in accordance with Example 1 of the Strobel et al U.S. Pat. No. 4,148,754, the n-propyl mag nesium chloride may well be totally soluble in the n heptane/diethyl ether mixture. However, when 15 g of silica are slurried in 200 ml of n-hexane and 50 ml of a 2.0 molar solution of ethylmagnesium chloride in tetra hydrofuran is added thereto in accordance with Exam ple 1 given herein, infra, the ethylmagnesium chloride appears to be only partially soluble in the n-hexane/tet rahydrofuran mixture. While the above-exemplified methods of incorporat ing a solid reactive magnesium composition onto a car rier are preferred, it will be understood that alternative methods are available. For instance, it is possible to precipitate a dialkylmagnesium composition onto a car rier from a hydrocarbyl or halohydrocarbyl solvent 10 \\n 15 \\n 20 \\n 25 \\n 30 \\n 35 \\n 40 \\n 45 \\n 50 \\n 55 \\n 60 \\n 65 10 \\n containing essentially no ether. It is also possible to combine carrier and a solid organomagnesium composi \\n tion in the absence of a solvent by means of a ball mill ing device. However, such a ball milling process is less preferred, particularly because it does not tend to effec tively incorporate a reactive magnesium compound into \\n the pores of the carrier. It is particularly noted that mechanical shearing means such as ball milling are not necessary to achieve the desired impregnation of catalyst onto carrier in accordance with aspects of the present invention. Ac cordingly, a ball milling process such as described in \\n Examples 2-5 of the Grant U.S. Pat. No. 3,821,186 is unnecessary and may be avoided. Moreover, a ball milling process may tend to disrupt the particle size and morphology of the carrier. Since catalysts made in ac cordance with aspects of the present invention are pref erably capable of being used in gas phase, fluid bed polymerizations, e.g., as described in the Karol et al U.S. Pat. No. 4,302,566, the particle size and morphol ogy of the catalyst may be rather critical. Accordingly, another reason for avoiding ball milling is to preserve the particle size and morphology of the carrier while it is being treated in accordance with aspects of the pres \\n ent invention. The solid supported magnesium-containing composi tion is preferably in the form of a free-flowing powder \\n when dry. It is particularly noted that when a carrier is impregnated by many of the above-exemplified meth \\n ods neither the carrier nor the magnesium is contacted with either an organoaluminum compound or an alumi num halide compound. Thus, such a treatment with a significant amount of an organoaluminum compound or an aluminum halide compound is preferably not part of the present invention. A carrier treated with an organomagnesium composi tion according to the above-exemplified methods may \\n be reacted with a tetravalent titanium compound in a liquid medium. The tetravalent titanium compound is soluble in this liquid reaction medium, while the treated carrier, including the magnesium containing portion \\n thereof, is insoluble in this liquid reaction medium. Thus, the reaction which takes place between the tetra valent titanium and the reactive magnesium-containing composition is a reaction of a solid with a liquid. It is \\n further noted that the reacted titanium is insoluble in the \\n liquid reaction medium. The reaction which takes place between a solid, sup ported organomagnesium compound and tetravalent \\n titanium in the liquid reaction medium is felt to be essen tially an oxidation/reduction reaction, wherein the or ganomagnesium composition acts as a reducing agent \\n for the tetravalent titanium. On the other hand, while not wishing to be bound by any particular theory or \\n chemical mechanism, the reaction which takes place between (1) tetravalent titanium and (2) the reaction product of a Grignard reagent and carrier containing reactive OH groups is not felt to be an oxidation/reduc tion reaction. However, it is noted that both of the above-mentioned reactions lead to the incorporation of titanium onto a support corresponding to the treated \\n carrier. Examples of tetravalent titanium compounds, which may be used in the liquid reaction medium, are given in the passage extending from line 35 to line 54 of column 6 of the Graff U.S. Pat. No. 4,173,547. Such examples include titanium halides (e.g., where the halide portion thereof is C or Br), titanium alkoxides (e.g., where the \n",

In step (a) of the process, the impregnation step using the \\n Solution of organometallic compound of the groups 1, 2, 12 or \\n 13, in aliphatic hydrocarbons, is carried out by using an amount of organometallic compound, ranging from 0.1 to 1 \\n mmole of the organometallic solution per mmole of OH on \\n the silica surface, preferably 0.3 to 0.7 mmoles of the orga \\n nometallic solution per mmole of OH on the silica surface.

In general, when preparing the solution of the step \\n (c), titanium is used in Such an amount that the molar ratio Ti/Mg varies within the range of 0.3 to 4, and preferably \\n within the range of 0.5 to 2. \\n 0065. In step (d) the silica obtained on step (b) is sus pended in an inert organic solvent, Such as a hydrocarbon \\n solvent of the aliphatic type, preferably the same used in the previous steps and the dissolved product prepared on Step (c) \\n is added to the Suspension. The impregnation is carried out by Suspending 100 parts by weight of silica, obtained on step \\n (b), for each 5 to 200 parts by volume of the component \\n prepared on Step (c) and after dilution in the inert organic \\n Solvent. The Suspension is maintained under stirring at a temperature that ranges from room temperature to the boil \\n ing point of the mixture, preferably at 60° C., over a period \\n of time from 30 to 180 minutes, preferably between 50 and 60 minutes. In this way a solid component Suspended in an \\n inert organic solvent is obtained. \\n 0066. Optionally the solid component obtained in step (d) \\n can be submitted to reducing conditions in a step (e). Said result is obtained, for example, by using reducing agents, Such as Na-alkyls, Li-alkyls, Zn-alkyls, Mg-alkyls and cor responding aryl-derivatives, Grignard compounds of the \\n type RMgX, wherein R represents a linear or branched alkyl group, containing from 1 to 10 carbons or aryl-derivatives \\n and X represents a halogen atom and preferably a chlorine atom, Al-alkyl halide compounds or by using reducing \\n agents such as silicon compounds. Particularly effective silicone compounds are the polymethylhydrosiloxanes in \\n which the monomer unit has the general formula HSiR O— wherein R is H. halogen, alkyl with I to 10 carbon \\n atoms, aryl with 6 to 10 carbon atoms, alkoxyl with 1 to 10 \\n carbon atoms, aryloxyl with 6 to 10 carbon atoms or carboxyl wit 1 to 10 carbon atoms, and n is a degree of polymerization that ranges between 5 and 100. Specific examples of such polymethylhydrosiloxanes (PMHS) \\n include the compounds: (CH)SiO (CH)HSiO— \\n Si(CH), wherein in varies from 1 to 35, (CHHSiO), (CHHSiO), HSi-O-SiHOSiFH, phenylhydropolysi \\n loxanes in which the hydrogen atoms can be partially replaced by methyl groups. \\n 0067. Other silicon compounds useful as reducing agents \\n in the practice of this invention are: silanes (SiH, in which m is a number equal to or higher than 1), alkyl-silanes \\n or aryl-silanes (RSiH, in which R is alkyl or aryl and X is a number varying from 1 to 3) and alkoxy-silanes or aryloxy-silanes (ROSiRI, in which R is alkyl or aryland \\n X is a number varying from 1 to 3). \\n 0068 The reducing agent chosen from the above examples, preferably polymethylhydrosiloxanes (PMHS), is \\n added to the solid obtained in the step (d), dissolved pref erably in the same inert organic solvent used for the reaction Suspension. This addition is carried out slowly over a period \\n of time from 30 to 180 minutes, preferably between 50 and \\n 80 minutes and the Solid Suspension is maintained under stirring at a temperature ranging from room temperature to \\n the boiling point of the aliphatic hydrocarbon used as \\n solvent, preferably at 60° C. \\n 0069. The amount of reducing agent that can be used in step (e) corresponds to the amount ranging from 0 to 2 moles \\n per mole of titanium, preferably between 0 and 0.1 mole per \\n mole of titanium. It has been observed, in the experiments, Jul. 27, 2006 \\n that the quantity used of this reducing agent can control the \\n amount of titanium fixed on silica at the final catalyst. \\n 0070. In the next step of the process according to the \\n present invention, the Suspension obtained in (d) or (e), \\n which is still under stirring, is put in contact and interacted with one or more halogenating agents. \\n 0071 Halogenating agents useful in the practice of the \\n present invention can be either liquid or gaseous materials, \\n pure or preferably dissolved in an inert organic solvent. Representative but non-exhaustive examples of halogenat \\n ing agents useful in the present invention are methylalumi num dichloride, methylaluminum sesquichloride, isobutyla \\n luminum dichloride, isobutylaluminum sesquichloride, \\n ethylaluminum dichloride (EADC), diethylaluminum chlo \\n ride (DEAC), ethylaluminum sesquichloride (EASC), SiCl, \\n SnCl4, HCl, Cl, HSiCl, aluminum chloride, ethylboron dichloride, boron chloride, diethylboron chloride, HCC1, PCls, POCl, acetyl chlorides, thionyl chloride, sulfur chlo \\n ride, methyl trichlorosilane, dimethyl dichlorosilane, TiCl, \\n VC1, CC1, t-butyl chloride, n-butyl chloride, chloroform, \\n 1,1,1-trichloroethane, 1,1,2-trichloroethane, 1,2-dichloroet \\n hane and dichloromethane. \\n 0072 The preferred halogenating agents are chlorinating \\n agents and of these SiCl, SnCl4, HCl, Cl, HSiCl, methyl \\n trichlorosilane, dimethyl dichlorosilane, t-butyl chloride, \\n n-butyl chloride, chloroform, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, 1,1,2- \\n trichloroethane, 1,2-dichloroethane and dichloromethane are preferred, most preferably SiCla. \\n 0073. The amount of halogenating agent used in the step (e of the process corresponds to the amount ranging from 0.5 \\n to 3 moles of halogenating agent per mole of titanium, \\n preferably between 1 and 1.8 moles of halogenating agent \\n per mole of titanium. \\n 0074 The time necessary for halogenating Ti-alkoxide \\n and optionally Mg-alkoxide varies from 0.5 hour to 5 hours, \\n preferably from 1.5 hours to 2.5 hours. The temperature of the Solid Suspension halogenation ranges from room tem perature to the boiling point of the aliphatic hydrocarbon \\n used as solvent, preferably at 60° C. \\n 0075 According to the present invention, in step (g) of \\n the process, the solid obtained in (f) is kept under higher temperature that depends on the inert organic solvent used. \\n 0076. The time necessary for this thermal treatment of the \\n solid obtained in step (f) ranges from 0.5 hour to 5 hours, preferably from 3 to 5 hours. The ideal temperature for this \\n purpose depends on the organic solvent used and it can be \\n conducted from 60° C. to 120° C., preferably from 60° C. to \\n 75° C., when hexane is used as the organic solvent. \\n 0077. At the step (h) after the thermal treatment, the solid can be separated from the Suspension, for example by \\n settling and siphoning, filtration or centrifugation, washed \\n with an inert organic solvent, preferably hexane, and then dried. The washing temperature can vary from room tem perature to the boiling point of the aliphatic hydrocarbon \\n used as solvent, preferably at room temperature. \\n 0078. Optionally, the solid obtained in (h) is washed with a solution of organometallic compounds of the groups 1, 2, \\n 12 or 13. More specifically, in the optional step (i) the solid \\n obtained in step (h) is suspended in an inert organic solvent \\n Such as hexane or heptane, and it is put in contact with one \n",
