 POLYMERIZATION CATALYST AND METHOD 
 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 
 In this invention, the polymerization catalysts useful in polymerizing and copolymerizing 1-olefins are pre 
 pared by the reaction of silica or alumina with a func tional silane compound, organomagnesium compound, 
 an alcohol, and a titanium, vanadium, zirconium or mixture of these compounds. These catalysts are then activated, associating them with an organoaluminum cocatalyst. These catalyst products are primarily useful for the polymerization of 1-olefins such as ethylene and the copolymerization of these 1-olefins. One of the features of the invention is to provide an improved method of polymerizing with these catalysts in the particle form slurry, gas phase or solution form polymerization processes. 
 Another feature of the invention is that the polymeri zation reactions promoted by the improved catalysts are more readily modified by hydrogen so that desirable high melt index polymers are easily made. A further feature is that the higher melt index poly mers so produced are narrow in molecular weight dis tribution and are therefore highly suitable for injection molding or cast film applications. 
 Yet another feature of the invention is to provide a catalyst yielding high melt index, high density polyeth 
 ylene in the particle form process without reactor foul 
 1ng. 
 Still another feature of this invention is the produc tion of ethylene-1-alkene copolymers, commonly 
 known as linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), by the catalyst of this invention. These copolymers can have densities from 0.915 to 0.960 g/cm3 and properties suitable for film and injection molding applications, for example. 
 K. Ziegler first discovered two component catalysts based on compounds of the Group IVB-VIIB metals of the periodic table and an organometallic compound belonging to Groups I-IIIA of the periodic table for the polymerization of olefins. Since his discovery, numer ous catalysts have been disclosed as improvements over the original Ziegler catalysts. Most of these catalyst systems are of relatively low activity and stability. They require a costly catalyst removal step. 
 One of the modifications attempted in an effort to increase the activity of the Ziegler type catalyst was to deposit the catalyst components on an inert support. In 
 U.S. Pat. No. 2,981,725, such a process is disclosed. The supports used were magnesium chloride, silicon car bide, silica gel, calcium chloride, etc. The activity of the catalysts disclosed in these patents 
 was still low. 
 South Africa Applm. No. 69/3534, 10/5/69 by Van Den Berg and Tomiers of Stamicarbon describes cata lysts made from organomagnesium compounds, alkyl 
 aluminum chloride compounds, and titanium com pounds which are increased in reactivity by the addition of alcohols. A support, or granular ingredient, is not 
 used, there is no separation of the solvent, and the use of a cocatalyst is not disclosed. German Offen. No. 2,721,058, 11/23/78, by Gunter Schweier et al. of BASF reveals a catalyst with a po rous inorganic oxide like silica or silica-alumina as a support. A solution of a reaction mixture of an alcohol, a titanium trihalide, and : a magnesium compound is 
 added to the oxide, and then the solvent (i.e. the alco 2 
 hol) is evaporated giving an intermediate solid product.

 65 This solid product is suspended in a solution of an or ganometallic compound, which may be an alkyl alumi 
 num or silicon halide compound. The suspended solid component may be used as is along with an organome tallic compound as a cocatalyst. The suspended solid 
 compound can also be filtered, and washed prior to use, and for gas phase polymerization it can be coated with wax. The magnesium compounds are not alkyl magne 
 sium compounds but alkoxides and halides and other types of compounds. 
 Another Schweier patent, German Offen. No. 2,721,094 is similar to this one. It reveals that the silica or silica-alumina may be treated with an alkyl aluminum halide compound beforehand. 
 U.S. Pat. No. 4,110,523, 8/29/78, also by Schweier et al., covers a similar catalyst. In this case, the treatment with the alkyl aluminum or silicon halide solution is 
 eliminated. 
 U.S. Pat. No. 4,130,699, 12/19/78 by G. R. Hoff and Peter Fotis of Standard Oil Company discloses sup ported catalysts for vapor phase polymerization which 
 are made less active prior to feeding to the reaction vessel by treatment with alcohols, acetates, ketones, aldehydes, or esters. 
 U.S. Pat. No. 4,105,585, 8/8/78 by Ian Matheson of BP Chemicals describes catalysts prepared from the reaction of magnesium powder, a titanium halide and 
 alcohol. 
 U.S. Pat. No. 3,647,772 by N. Kashiwa (Mitsuit Pet rochemical, 5/7/72) involves treating anhydrous mag nesium carbonate with polar organic compounds in 
 cluding alcohols. When this is done, more titanium from titanium tetrachloride can be fixed upon the magnesium carbonate. Catalyst reactivity, melt index and bulk den sity of the product are increased by the treatment with the polar organic compound. 
 None of the above patents disclose the method and products of this invention. 
 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 
 The catalysts of this invention are formed from four 
 reactive materials. One of the reactive materials is the 
 product formed by the interaction of an oxide like silica or alumina with an organic silicon compound. This 
 silane-treated silica or alumina is combined with an 
 organomagnesium compound, an alcohol, and a tita nium or vanadium compound. From the resulting reac tion mixture, a solid, free-flowing catalyst is separated. The catalyst so formed is activated by an organoalumi num compound. 
 This invention provides novel catalysts, methods of making them and methods of polymerizing and copoly merizing 1-olefins. These catalysts are especially useful for the polymerization of ethylene to high density poly ethylene, and for the copolymerization of ethylene with 
 1-olefins for the formation of medium and low density copolymers. These improved catalysts are highly active 
 and are well suited for the economical and energy effi cient particle form and gas phase processes. Specifically, the object of this invention is to improve the well known Ziegler type catalyst by the method of this invention. These improved catalysts can be easily adapted to the particle form or gas phase process plants. 
 Polymers made using the invention catalysts can have 
 high MI and narrow molecular weight distribution. Thus, polymers well suited for injection molding and "
2,US4374753.pdf,/home/anatoly_kayda/Desktop/mipt/data/chemplex/US/US4374753.pdf,3,NO,100.0, NO,0.0,"4,374,753 3 rotational molding applications can be manufactured. The catalysts of this invention are stable, particulate, 
 and easy flowing. . . . . - 
 The alcohol modification allows the production of higher melt index polymers in response to the addition of hydrogen to the polymerization reaction. The silane treatment, in comparison with catalysts prepared with 
 out the silane treatment of the silica or alumina, leads to polymers of more narrow molecular weight distribu tions. The catalysts of this invention surprisingly retain both of these good features and are thus superior for the production of high melt index injection molding resins by ethylene polymerization. A totally unexpected advantage of the invention cata lysts is that they can produce ethylene-1-olefin copoly 
 mers (so-called LLDPE, linear low density polyethyl ene), with melt elasticity properties suitable for the manufacture of high strength blown film. The catalysts of this invention yield polymers with high melt index values at relatively low hydrogen con centration in the polymerization reaction. Thus, less hydrogen is required to obtain a given desired high melt index. This affords a savings on hydrogen and gives a higher reactivity because higher concentrations of hy drogen decrease the polymerization rate. The catalysts 
 of this invention give a relatively narrow molecular weight distribution at a given melt index. A narrow molecular weight distribution is desirable in polymers used for injection molding and in cast film applications because better strength is obtained. In the copolymerization of 1-olefins and ethylene to form low density copolymers of lower melt index, the catalysts of this invention can produce products with superior melt elasticity which is associated with high strength blown film. The catalysts of this invention are made from a com bination of silica or alumina, certain organic silicon compounds, an organomagnesium compound, an alco 
 hol, and a titanium compound. The catalysts are acti vated by an organoaluminum compound. 
 The silica or alumina materials may contain minor amounts of zirconia, magnesia, or titania. For catalyst manufacture, it is preferred to have relatively finely 
 divided silica or alumina, which may be porous or non 
 porous. The organic silicon compound must have at least one functional group which can react with the surface hy droxyl groups of the silica or alumina, and by means of this reaction the organic silicon residue must be bonded to the surface of the silica or alumina or mixtures of 
 these. Prior to the reaction between the organic silicon compound and the silica or alumina, the silica or alu mina may be dried to completely remove the water at a temperature less than about 800 C. The drying may be 
 only partial so as to leave a small amount of water to catalyze the reaction of the organic silicon compound with the surface groups. Usually, it is preferred to at least partially remove the surface water from the silica 
 or alumina. The amount of organic silicon compound may be in excess of the reactive surface groups. In this case, the conversion of the surface groups can be made as com plete as possible, and the unreacted excess can be re moved by distillation at less than 200° C., at pressures less than one atmosphere if necessary, or by heating combined with purging with an inert gas. The reaction product of the silica or alumina with the organic silicon compound should not be heated above 300 C., since 5

 decomposition of the bonded silane groups may occur. The amount of organic silicon compound may be less than the stoichiometric equivalent of the surface reac tive groups. In this case, no removal of excess is neces 
 sary. 
 The alcohols that are suitable for this invention con tain only one alcoholic hydroxyl group per molecule, and only carbon and hydrogen atoms in addition to the one oxygen atom. Phenols or alcohols with the hy droxyl directly bonded to an aromatic ring are not suit 
 able. 
 The alcohol can be added to the silane-treated silica or alumina immediately prior to the addition of the organomagnesium compound. The alcohol can also be added after the organomagnesium compound. It must, however, be combined into the catalyst mixture before the titanium compound. The reaction of the alcohol with the catalyst ingredi ents can be conducted at temperatures between 15° C. to about 100° C. but about room temperatures is com pletely satisfactory. 
 The amount of alcohol is chosen to give an alcohol to magnesium ratio between 0.1 to 5. Ratios higher than 2 * give less reactive catalysts and are not normally desired. Ratios less than 0.5 normally do not result in a sufficient increase in hydrogen response. A ratio of about 1.0 is preferred. 
 The amount of titanium compound is normally less than the amount equivalent to the reactive surface groups. However, the amount of titanium compound can vary from 5% to 200% of that equivalent amount. Trialkylaluminum compounds such as triethylalumi num and triisobutylaluminum are excellent cocatalysts. Alkyl aluminum hydrides like diisobutyl aluminum hy dride can be used. Mixtures of organoaluminum com pounds are suitable. An example is a combination of triisobutylaluminum and diethyl aluminum ethoxide. 
 The amount of cocatalyst is not critical. The molar ratio of organoaluminum cocatalyst to titanium com pound in the solid, free-flowing catalyst can range from 0.1/1 to 100/1. Preferably, the ratio is from 1/1 to 10/1. Activation of the catalyst with the cocatalyst can be accomplished within the polymerization reactor by the simultaneous feeding of both components. Alterna tively, the cocatalyst can be added to the catalyst prior to entry into the polymerization zone. 
 DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED 
 EMBODIMENTS 
 The catalysts of this invention have higher melt index capability and reactivity than normal Ziegler catalysts. These catalysts are simple to prepare and in the pre 
 ferred method, are highly economical because of the lack of necessity of calcination, solvent washing, high temperature reaction, grinding, etc. In this invention, the silicon compound has one or more reactive groups for each silicon atom in the mole cule. One of these reactive groups may be consumed by a surface reaction. Then the attached silicon atom may have no reactive group or it could have some reactive groups. The remaining reactive groups can interact with the magnesium component of the catalyst. By such interaction, the polymerization reactions can be influ enced toward desirable properties in the polymer prod 
 ucts. The silicon compounds useful in this invention have the following structural formulae: "

 where m is 1, 2 or 3, n is 3, 2 or 1, respectively, and the total of m--n=4, X is a group chemically reactive with the hydroxyl groups of the silica or alumina such as chloride, amide, alkoxide, phenoxide and the like. The invention requires at least one such reactive group. If more than one are used, they may be the same or differ ent. Examples of reactive groups are -F, -Cl, --Br, 
 -OCH3, -OCH2CH5, -NH2, -NCCH3)2, -N(H- )Si(CH3)3, -CH2CH2CH2Cl, -CH2CH2CH2NH2, -OCH2CH2OCH3, -O2CCH3, . . . and -CH2CH2CH2SH. The R group is a hydrocarbon group containing only carbon and hydrogen. It may be, for example, alkyl, phenyl, or alkenyl such as vinyl. 
 The silicas or aluminas that are suitable for this inven 
 tion may contain minor amounts of zirconia, magnesia, or titania. For catalyst manufacture, it is preferred to have relatively finely divided silica or alumina, which may be porous or nonporous. . 
 Prior to reaction with the silane, the silica or alumina may be dried to completely remove surface water at a temperature less than 800° C. The drying may instead be only partial in some cases in order to leave a small amount of water, or the drying can be eliminated en tirely depending on the structure of the organosilane compound. Usually, it is preferred to at least partially remove the surface water from the silica or alumina. 6 possible to make high melt index particle form polyeth ylene with less hydrogen and at a lower polymerization temperature. The molar ratio of alcohol to magnesium alkyl is 0.1-5, most preferably 0.5-2.0. 5 The Group IVB and Group VB metals that are espe cially useful in this invention include titanium, zirco 
 nium and vanadium.

 these groups having 1 to 12 carbon atoms, and X is halogen. When more than one R2 group occurs in the 20 titanium compound, the groups can be the same or different. Titanium tetrachloride is a preferred compound. The amount of titanium compound is preferably less than the amount equivalent to the surface reactive groups. 25 Nonetheless, this invention includes amounts of tita nium compound, which are from 1 to 200 percent of that equivalent amount. Following the reaction with the titanium compound, it is necessary to remove the excess solvent in order to For example, in the case of hexamethyl disilazane, a 30 have a free-flowing catalyst.

The unreacted excess of silicon compound can be removed by distillation at less than 200 C. at decreased pressure if necessary, or by heat and inert gas purging. The reaction product of the silica or alumina with the silane should not be heated above 300 C., which might lead to thermal decomposition of the bonded silane groups. The amount of silane compound may also be less than the stoichiometric equivalent of the reactive groups upon the silica or alumina. In this case, all of the silane compound may become attached to the surface so that no removal of excess is necessary. The organomagnesium compounds useful in this in vention are the alkyls or aryls of magnesium.or.its com plexes such as complexes with alkyl aluminum com pounds. The structural formulae of some preferred compounds are R2MgX1, R'2Mg and (R22Mg). AlR32 where R2 is alkyl containing 1-10 carbon atoms or aryl such as phenyl, naphthyl and cyclopentadienyl and n is

 aluminum halides can also be used. The complexes may contain small amounts of aluminum or magnesium al 
 koxides. The amount of organomagnesium compound added 60 to make the catalysts of this invention is determined by the amount of titanium compound. Normally, the Mg/Tiratio is from 0.1 to 5, most preferably 1.0. The addition of alcohol to the catalyst preparation is before the tetravalent titanium compound but can be before or after the addition of magnesium alkyl. The catalyst of this invention has an enhanced sensitivity to molecular weight control by hydrogen. This makes it 45 
 50 The alkyl aluminum cocatalyst can be chosen from trialkyl aluminum compounds and alkyl aluminum hy dride compounds and their mixtures. The alkyl groups of suitable cocatalysts have hydrocarbon chains con 
 40 taining one or about ten carbon atoms and may be straight chained or branched. Triaryl aluminum com pounds may also be used but because they are not so readily obtained as the alkyl compounds, they are not preferred. Examples of suitable cocatalysts are triethyl 
 aluminum, trioctyl aluminum, tri(2-methyl pentyl )aluminum and diethyl aluminum hydride. Trisobutyl aluminum and diisobutylaluminum hydride are espe cially preferred. If needed, alkyl aluminum halides may be used along with the alkyl aluminum compounds 
 described above. 
 The cocatalyst may be fed to the polymerization 
 reactor along with the above-described solid compo nent in the same or preferably separate lines. The molar is ratio of the cocatalyst to the Group IVB and VB metal compounds in the solid component can be from 0.1:1 to 100:1 although the preferred range is 1:1 to 20:1. When using the catalyst according to the invention, at least one 1-olefin of the formula R6-CH=CH2, where R6 is hydrogen or a straight chain or branched alkyl radical having from 1 to 10, preferably from 1 to 8, carbon atoms is polymerized. Examples of such ole ...fins are ethylene, propylene, butene-1, hexene-1, 4 methyl-pentene-1, octene-1. 65. The polymerization may be carried out in suspension, solution or in the gaseous phase, continuously or dis continuously, at a temperature of from 20-300' C, preferably from 60-110' C., under a pressure of from   "

 atmospheric to 10,000 psi gauge. It is carried out prefer ably under the technically interesting pressure in the 
 range of from 300-800 psi. The melt index of the polyethylene produced by the 
 invention catalyst can be controlled by methods known to the art such as increasing the temperature of poly merization or by the addition of hydrogen. These cata lysts show relatively high activity in ethylene polymeri zation and copolymerization. The polymers can be eas 
 ily blended with antioxidants and pelletized for com mercial use. High partial pressures of hydrogen can be used to yield very high melt index products. The catalysts are useful for producing polymers of 
 1-olefins of 2 to 8 carbon atoms and copolymers of these 
 with 1-olefins of 2 to 20 carbon atoms to form solid polymers or copolymers. 
 EXAMPLES 
 EXAMPLE 1 
 A catalyst was made with silica treated with hex amethyl disilazane and with the addition of n-butyl alcohol. A control catalyst was made without the addi tion of the alcohol for comparison. Davison Chemical grade 952 silica was treated with hexamethyl disilazane. A 2.6 g quantity of the treated silica was transferred to a dry, nitrogen-filled flask. The silica was stirred with a magnet bar for one hour while a flow of N2 was passed through the flask. Then 7.7 ml of dibutyl magnesium-triethyl aluminum complex 
 (Mg/Al=6.1) solution, 8.9 wt.% in heptane, 0.59 ml n-butyl alcohol, and 16.25 ml of heptane were added sequentially. The combination was kept at room tem perature, under continuous N2 flow, and stirring for 30 
 minutes. Then 0.36 ml titanium tetrachloride was 
 added, and the combination stirred an additional 30 minutes at room temperature. The flask was immersed in a constant temperature bath at 90° C. until the hep tane was evaporated and carried away by the N2 stream. The catalyst remained in the flask as a free-flowing, light-yellow colored powder. The catalysts were tested for ethylene polymerization 
 at 215 F. with 500 ml isobutane in a 1400 ml vessel. 
 Triisobutyl aluminum (TIBAL) solution in an amount of 9.2 mmoles per gram of catalyst was added for each test. The total pressure was 550 psig in each case. The following results were obtained:

 Another catalyst was made as described in Example 1 except that the proportions of magnesium compound, 
 butyl alcohol, and titanium chloride were increased relative to the silane-treated silica. In this example, the amount of titanium tetrachloride was 1.75 mmol per gram of silane-treated silica instead of 1.25 mmol per gram. The Ti/Mg and alcohol to magnesium ratios were kept equal to 1.0. For comparison, a catalyst was made in the same way 
 but without the addition of the n-butyl alcohol. O

 The two catalysts were tested in a 2 1 polymerization vessel. A 1000 ml volume of isobutane was pressured into the vessel as a slurry medium, and hydrogen was added to give a 100 psi pressure increase. During the polymerization tests, ethylene was fed as required to keep the total pressure constant at 550 psig. TIBAL at 9.2 mmoles per gram was the catalyst. The tests showed that the invention catalyst gave a much higher melt

 Another test of the catalyst of Example 2 was done in the 2 l pressure vessel but with only 50 psi hydrogen 
 added instead of 100 psi. This test gave an hourly catalyst reactivity of 5052 
 with the product having a melt index of 2.4 and an RD value of 3.6. Previously, a comparison catalyst had been 
 made in a similar way but without silane-treated silica. in place of the silane-treated Davison 952 silica, ther mally treated silica was used. The temperature of treat ment was 600 C. This comparison catalyst gave an hourly reactivity of 224.5, a melt index of 3.0, and an RD 
 value of 4.5. The RD value is a measure of molecular 
 weight distribution and was measured as described in the article in Polymer Engineering and Science, Vol. II, pages 124-128 (1971). The lower RD value of the poly mer produced by the invention catalyst shows the prod uct to be more suitable for injection molding applica 
 tions. 
 EXAMPLE 4 
 The two catalysts of Example 2 were tested for ethy lene-butene copolymerization in a 1400 ml pressure vessel. In each case a sample of the catalyst, a volume of 25 wt.% triisobutyl aluminum solution and 500 ml of isobutane were introduced into the polymerization wes sel. The amount of trisobutyl aluminum solution was chosen to give 9.2 mmol/g of solid catalyst. The tem perature of polymerization was 160' F. After the isobu tane addition, hydrogen was added to give a 50 psi increase in pressure. Ethylene and 1-butene were then metered in over a period of five to seven minutes. Eth ylene was added as required to give a total pressure of 
 350 psig while the amount of 1-butene added was ap proximately 22 wt.% of the reaction vessel contents. 
 The reactions were continued for one hour after the 350 
 psig total pressure was attained. During this hour an additional 15 g quantity ofbutene was added to replace the portion polymerized. 
 The results of the tests showed that the invention catalyst gave a low density copolymer with superior melt elasticity. The invention catalyst also gave a higher melt index and reactivity:

 EXAMPLE'S 
 A catalyst was made in the same manner as described in Example 1 except that a different magnesium com pound was used. A 1.8g quantity of hexamethyldisila 
 Zane-treated silica was combined in a nitrogen atmo sphere with 20 ml of heptane and 5.7 ml of abutyl octyl magnesium solution in heptane. The quantity of butyl octyl magnesium was 2.25 mmoles. The combination was stirred one half hour at room temperature, then 0.21 ml of n-butyl alcohol was added. This mixture was stirred for one half hour. A 0.25 ml volume of titanium tetrachloride was added as small drops from a syringe to form the catalyst slurry. The slurry was kept at room temperature for another thirty minutes, then the flask 
 was immersed in an oil bath at 100 C. The flask was 
 kept in the bath for 30 minutes at the end of which time the solvents had evaporated leaving a free-flowing 
 solid. 
 Another catalyst was made with the butyl octyl mag nesium solution in the same way except that the n-butyl alcohol was omitted. 
 The two catalysts were tested under identical condi tions as described in Example 2, in a 21 polymerization vessel with 100 psi hydrogen at 215 F. The results show that the alcohol catalyst gave polyethylene of higher melt index.

 EXAMPLE 6 
 This example shows the use of another magnesium compound. A catalyst was prepared with the addition of n-butyl alcohol in the same way as the catalyst of Example 5 except that a dibutyl magnesium solution was added instead of the butyl octyl magnesium solu tion. The dibutyl magnesium solution was obtained from the Lithium Corporation of America. In this prod uct, a portion of butyl groups are secondary butyl groups and the remainder are normal butyl groups. A polymerization test was conducted as in Example 5 giving polyethylene with a melt index of 49 and a reac tivity of 1463 g/g cat. hr. 
 EXAMPLE 7 
 In this example, the molar ratio of the alcohol to the magnesium compound was varied. Three catalysts were made with the addition of n-butyl alcohol as described in Example 5 but with different amounts of alcohol. Also, in this case, butyl ethyl magnesium was used as the magnesium compound. The amount of butyl ethyl magnesium solution for each of the three catalysts was 1.25 mmoles per gram of the hexamethyldisilazane 
 treated silica. The amount of titanium tetrachloride was 
 also 1.25 mmoles per gram in each case. However, the volume of n-butyl alcohol added was varied as shown 10 
 below with the results of polymerization tests. Polymer

 EXAMPLE 8 
 This example shows the preparation of a catalyst with aMg/Tiatomic ratio of 0.5 instead of the Mg/Tiatomic ratio of 1.0 in previous examples. The procedure for preparation was the same as in Example 5, and butyl ethyl magnesium was the magnesium compound. A 2.1 
 g quantity of the silane-treated silica was transferred to the dry, N2-purged flask. A 20 ml volume of heptane and 1.91 ml of the butyl ethyl magnesium solution were combined with the silica. With reaction periods as in Example 5, 0.11 ml n-butyl alcohol and 0.29 ml of tita nium tetrachloride were added. The solvent was evapo rated by heating at 100° C. for 50 minutes. In the poly merization test at 215 F. with 100 psi H2, polyethylene with a melt index of 36 was produced. The reactivity of the catalyst was 2471 g/g cat. hr. TIBAL solution at 9.2 mmoles per gram of catalyst was again employed as the cocatalyst. 
 EXAMPLE 9 
 This example shows that the magnesium to titanium atomic ratio can be greater than 1.0 in the invention catalyst. The procedure and ingredients were the same as in Example 8 but the Mg/Tiatomic ratio was 1.5, the butyl ethyl magnesium to n-butyl alcohol molar ratio 
 was 1.0, and the titanium tetrachloride was 1.25 mmoles per gram of silane-treated silica. The catalyst was tested for the synthesis of a 1 butene-ethylene copolymer as described in Example 4. 
 The reactivity was found to be 4364 g/g cat. hr. The melt index of the product was 2.9 and its density was 0.927. 
 The catalyst was also tested in the particle form syn thesis of polyethylene as described in Example 2. The melt index of the homopolymer was 57, and the reactiv ity of the catalyst under the given conditions was 1917 g/g cat. hr. 
 EXAMPLE 10 
 A catalyst was prepared as in Example 1 except that benzyl alcohol was added to the preparation instead of butyl alcohol. The catalyst was tested in ethylene butene copolymerization as described in Example 2. The catalyst reactivity was 1321 g/g cat. per hour, and 
 the melt index was 2.6. 
 EXAMPLE 11 
 A quantity of Davison Chemical Company grade 952 
 silica was first dried at 300 C. in a bed fluidized by nitrogen. A 1.3 g quantity of the dried silica was trans ferred to a flask, and combined with 15 ml hexane and 0.24 ml of allyldimethylchlorosilane. The amount of allyldimethylchlorosilane was 1.25 mmoles per gram of 
 silica. The combination was stirred in an inert atmo 
 sphere at room temperature for 30 minutes. At this "

stage, volatile materials were evaporated in a nitrogen 11 
stream by immersing the flaskin a bath at 100° C. Upon cooling, 15 ml hexane and 3.9 ml of dibutyl magnesium triethylaluminum complex solution (Mg/Al=6.1) were 
 added. After 30 minutes, 0.15 ml of n-butyl alcohol was added. The molar ratio of alcohol to dibutyl magnesium 
 was calculated to be 1.0. After an additional 30 minutes, 
 0.13 ml of titanium tetrachloride was added. The sol 
 vents were evaporated in a nitrogen stream at 100 C. The dry catalyst was white. 
 The catalyst was tested with triisobutyl aluminum cocatalyst in ethylene-butene copolymerization as de 
 scribed in Example 2. The reactivity was 2735 g/g cat. per hour, the melt index was 4.8, and the density was 
 0.919. 
 This example shows that allyldimethyl chlorosilane can be the silane compound. 
 EXAMPLE 12 
 The catalyst of Example 11 was tested in ethylene hexene copolymerization. The procedure was similar to 
 that described in Example 2. Instead of about 22 wt.% 
 butene, about 26 wt.% 1-hexane was added. Also, in stead of a total pressure of 350 psig, the pressure in this test was 300 psig. The product was recovered as particles. Its melt index was 6.5, and its density was 0.924. The catalyst reactivity was 2095 g/g cat. per hour. This example shows that low density ethylene-hexene 
 copolymers can be made with the catalyst of this inven 
 tion. 
 EXAMPLE 13 
 A catalyst was prepared in Example 11 except that an equimolar amount of n-dodecyl trichlorosilane was substituted for the allyldimethylchlorosilane. This catalyst was tested in ethylene-butene copoly merization as described in Example 2. The product 5

 copolymer had a density of 0.919 and a melt index of 40 3.1. The reactivity was 2832 g/g cat. per hour. 
 EXAMPLE 14 
 Again, a catalyst was made as in Example 11, but with a different silane compound. The silane compound was N,O-bis-(trimethylsilyl)acetamide. In an ethylene 
 butene copolymerization test like Example 2, the reac 
 tivity was found to be 2010 g/g cat. per hour. 
 EXAMPLE 15 
 A catalyst was made as in Example 11, but with N trimethylsilyl diethylamine. In ethylene-butene copoly 
 merization, the reactivity was found to be 3351 g/g cat. per hour. 
 EXAMPLE 16 
 In this example the order of addition of the catalyst components is different. Davison Chemical grade 952 silica was treated with hexamethyldisilazane. Prior to catalyst preparation, this treated silica was heated at 100° C. for one hour in flowing nitrogen. To 2.0 g of the treated silica, 20 ml of hexane and 0.23 ml of n-butyl 
 alcohol were added. The combination was stirred for 30 minutes, then 5.94 ml of a dibutyl magnesium triethyl aluminum complex solution was added (Mg/Al=6.1). The concentration was 8.9 wt.%, and the solvent was heptane. After another 30 minutes, 0.28 ml of titanium tetrachloride was added. The liquids were evaporated 45

 at 100 C. under nitrogen starting 30 minutes after the 
 addition of the titanium tetrachloride. 
 The catalyst was tested three times in copolymeriza tions with the following results:

 The temperature of the experiments was 160 F. for butene copolymerization and 155 F. for hexene copoly merization. For butene copolymerizations, the total pressure was 350 psig, and for hexene copolymeriza tion, it was 300 psig, Hydrogen to give a 50 psi increase in pressure was added to the isobutane, which was the 
 solvent in each test. 
 EXAMPLE 17 
 An invention catalyst was made again like Example 
 16 except that the butyl alcohol was added after the magnesium compound instead of before it. This catalyst was tested as described in Example 16.

 This example and Example 16 show that increased 
 melt index values can be obtained with the catalyst of 
 this invention when the alcohol is added before the 
 magnesium compound and after the magnesium com pound.
