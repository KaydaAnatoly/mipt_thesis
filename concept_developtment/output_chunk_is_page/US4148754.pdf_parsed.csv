 PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OFA 
 CATALYST AND CATALYST USED IN OLEFN 
 POLYMERZATION 
 The present invention relates to the preparation of a catalyst for the polymerization of ethylene and higher 
 1-olefins. 
 A process for the preparation of a catalyst for use in the polymerization of olefins has been described, in which organic alkali metal compounds are allowed to act on the hydroxyl groups of finely dispersed metal 
 oxides, for example silicon dioxide, and the reaction product is reacted subsequently with a metal halide selected from group VIIa of the Periodic system, espe cially manganese hexachloride (cf. U.S. Pat. No. 3,205,177). The solid obtained gives a catalyst suitable for use in the olefin polymerization when combined with a metallo-organic compound the metal of which is selected from one of groups I to III of the periodic system. These catalysts, however, have a low activity and produce only 1.4 kg of polyethylene per gram of manganese in 3 hours at a polymerization temperature 
 of 95 C. and under an ethylene pressure of 98 atmo spheres. 
 A further process comprises impregnating a solid 
 carrier, for example calcium carbonate, with an alumi num-organic compound and treating it subsequently 
 with an excess of titanium tetrachloride, whereby re 
 duced titanium trichloride forms a sediment on the 
 carrier (cf. British Pat. No. 927,969). Thereafter the excess of titanium tetrachloride must be removed. The 
 polymerization activity of the catalysts thus obtained, 
 however, is likewise so low that the residual catalyst must be removed from the polyolefin produced. Furthermore, there are known catalysts used in the polymerization of olefins, which are obtained by treat ing an oxide, hydroxide, carbonate or sulfate of magne sium or calcium with an aluminum-organic compound and subsequently reacting the compound obtained with 
 a mixture of halides of titanium and vanadium (cf. Ger man Auslegeschrift No. 2,140,326). In the preparation of these catalysts the aluminum-organic compound and 
 the transition metal compound of titanium and vana 10

 35 
 dium are used in an amount such that the separation of 45 an excess of these compounds may be dispensed with, but on the other hand, active catalysts for the polyolefin polymerization cannot be obtained when using as transi tion metal compounds solely titanium compounds. A catalyst, for example, which had been prepared by re acting magnesium oxide with aluminum triethyl and by subsequently treating the product obtained with tita nium tetrachloride yielded per hour only 19.5g of poly ethylene per 1 gram of titanium under an ethylene pres sure of 39 atmospheres. A secondary treatment of the polyethylene obtained was necessary for removing the 
 residual catalyst because of the discoloration of poly ethylene. 
 Finally a process for the preparation of supported 
 catalysts has been disclosed, in which an excess of a metallo-organic magnesium or aluminum compound is 
 allowed to act on silicon dioxide, aluminum oxide or a 
 mixture consisting of silicon dioxide and aluminum oxide having superficial hydroxyl groups and the reac 
 tion product is reacted, after the excess of said organo metallic compound has been removed by washing, with an excess of a halogen compound of a transition metal selected from one of groups IVa, Va or VIa of the 50 
 55 
 65 2 
 periodical system, and the excess of the transition metal compound is removed by washing with a solvent. By washing out the metallo-organic compounds of magne 
 sium or aluminum and the transition metals there are formed highly diluted solutions, which must be decom posed subsequently. As a consquence thereof, undesired 
 waste products are obtained, which are contained in the waste water (cf. German Offenlegungsschrift No. 
 2,109,273). It has now been found that a catalyst suitable for use in the polymerization of 1-olefins can be obtained by starting from the reaction product of silicon dioxide and/or a metal oxide with a Grignard compound as a carrier and a soluble titanium compound, which cata lyst gives high yields and allows a good control of the molecular weight by means of hydrogen without mak ing a separation of the excess of metallo-organic com pounds and/or of titanium compounds from the carrier 
 necessary. The present invention consequently provides a pro cess for the preparation of a catalyst by reacting the reaction product of silicon dioxide and/or aluminum oxide and 1. a halogen-containing magnesium-organic compound and 2. a halogen compound of a transition metal (component A) with a metallo-organic compound (component B), which comprises reacting a silicon di oxide and/or aluminum oxide having a hydroxyl con tent of from 0.5 to 50 mmols/g first with a magnesium compound of the formula RMgX, in which R is a hy droxarbon radical having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms and X is chlorine, bromine or iodine, in the presence of a diluent, in an amount of from 0.05 to 1 mol of magne sium compound per mol of hydroxyl groups of the carrier and reacting thereafter the solid reaction prod uct in suspension with a halogen-containing titanium (IV) compound of the formula TiX(OR))4-, in which n is an integer of from 1 to 4, X is chlorine or bromine and R is a hydrocarbon radical having of from 1 to 12 
 carbon atoms, in an amount of from 0.01 to 1 mol of titanium compound per mol of hydroxyl groups of the carrier, to obtain the component A. Suitable carriers are porous oxides or mixed oxides of silicon and/or aluminum having a specific surface of from 50 to 1000 m2/g, preferably from 100 to 800, espe cially from 150 to 650 and a pore volume in the range of from 0.2 to 2 ml/g, preferably of from 0.4 to 2, espe cially of from 0.6 to 1.7 ml/g. The particle size is in the range of from 1 to 500 am, preferably from 10 to 200 um, especially of from 20 to 100 um. The number of hydroxyl groups depends on the specific surface and the temperature of the preliminary treatment and is in the range of from 0.5 to 50 mmols preferably of from 1 to 20 mmols, especially of from 1.5 to 10 mmols, hydroxyl groups per gram of carrier. Several of these oxides are prepared especially for being used as a carrier of sup ported catalysts. They are commercial products. Prior to the reaction of the hydroxyl groups of the carrier with the halogen-containing magnesium-organic compounds the absorbed water must be removed by drying at a temperature of from 120 to 800° C., prefera bly of from 200 to 500 C. The number of hydroxyl groups (mmol of hydroxyl groups per gram of carrier) may be modified by said treatment at high temperature, whereby it is reduced with an increasing temperature. After drying the carrier is kept under an inert gas atmosphere, for example nitrogen or argon, with the 
 exclusion of air or water. "
2,US4148754.pdf,/home/anatoly_kayda/Desktop/mipt/data/hoehst/US/US4148754.pdf,3,NO,77.73,YES,22.27,"4,148,754 3 Suitable halogen-containing magnesium-organic compounds are compounds of the formula RMgX, in which R is a hydrocarbon radical having from 1 to 20, preferably from 2 to 10 carbon atoms and X is chlorine, bromine or iodine. These compounds are known as Grignard compounds and may be prepared, for example by reaction of metallic magnesium with a halogenhy drocarbon having from 1 to 20, preferably from 2 to 10 carbon atoms, for example an alkyl, -cycloalkyl-or aryl halide, in the presence of a nucleophilic solvent, for example an ether (cf. Organikum, VEB Deutscher Ver lag der Wissenschaften, Berlin, 1964, page 466). These compounds may also be prepared in a hydrocarbon in 
 the absence of an ether. Preferred magnesium com pounds are ethyl magnesium chloride, n-propyl magne sium chloride, i-propyl magnesium iodide, n-butyl mag nesium chloride, t-butyl magnesium chloride, phenyl and magnesium bromide. n-Propyl magnesium chloride and n-butyl magnesium chloride are particularly prefer 
 able. The Grignard compound reacts in known manner with the hydroxyl groups placed at the surface of the carrier at a temperature below 100° C. while splitting off hydrocarbon, with the addition of -Mgx to the oxygen of the hydroxyl group according to the follow ing equation: 
 - - 
 -o-it-oh -- RMgX -o-i-o-Mex -- R-H 
 -O -O 
 Consequently one mol of magnesium alkyl chloride is chemically bound per mole of hydroxyl groups of the carrier. The number of hydroxyl groups of the carrier may, consequently, be determined by volumetric or chromatographic analysis of the hydrocarbon formed or by retitration of the excess of Grignard compound. The reaction of the solid carrier with the Grignard compound may be carried out in the following way: The solid carrier is suspended in an inert diluent, the dissolved Grignard compound is added at a tempera ture of from -20° to 150° C., preferably of from 0 to 120° C., especially of from 20' to 100° C., and allowed to act on the suspension for a period of from 0.5 to 20, preferably from 0.5 to 10, especially from 0.5 to 2, hours. The proportion of Grignard compound and solid carrier is chosen such that from 0.05 to 1, preferably from 0.1 to 0.95, mol of alkyl magnesium halide is used per mole of hydroxyl groups of the carrier. The magne sium compound is applied on the carrier quantitatively in said process. The reaction is completed when no more magnesium can be detected in the supernatant 
 solution after the solid carrier has settled. 
 Suitable diluents are all solvents inert with regard to Grignard compounds, for example saturated hydrocar bons or ethers, for example pentane, hexane, heptane, diethyl ether, tetrahydrofurane, or mixture of both types of compounds. After completion of the above reaction the diluent is separated by filtration and drying or directly by distilla tion, at a temperature of from 50 to 200 C., if it con tains an ether. The separation of the diluent is necessary for removing the ether, which has been used for the preparation of the Grignard compound and formed a complex with said compound, owing to the fact that the ether also reacts with the titanium compound while forming a complex and deactivates the catalyst.

 The separated diluent may be reused after having 
 been recovered. The solid carrier impregnated with the Grignard compound is thereafter suspended again in an inert dispersing agent, preferably in an inert hydrocarbon. A dispersing agent conventionally used for the polymeri zation under low pressure according to Ziegler is 
 chosen preferably. When not an ether but a saturated hydrocarbon is used for the preparation of the Grignard compound, the 
 diluent need not be separated and the titanium(IV) com pound may be directly added to the reaction mixture. Suitable inert dispersing agents are aliphatic or cycloali phatic hydrocarbons, for example pentane, hexane, heptane, cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane as well as 
 aromatic hydrocarbons, for example benzene, toluene, 
 xylene, and furthermore benzine or Diesel oil fractions, which have been carefully purified of oxygen, sulfur compounds and moisture, may be used. To the suspension obtained there is added subse quently a halogen-containing titanium(IV) compound, at a temperature of from 20 to 140 C., preferably of from 30 to 130 C, especially of from 40 to 120° C. and the mixture is stirred at this temperature until a titanium compound can no longer be detected in the suernatant solution, generally within a period of from 2 to 20 
 hours. The halogen-containing titanium(IV) compound is a compound of the formula TiXn (OR)4-, wherein n is an integer of from 1 to 4 and X is chlorine or bromine and R is a hydrocarbon radical, preferably an alkyl, aryl or aralkyl radical having from 1 to 12, preferably from 1 to 8 carbon atoms, especially a straight chain or branched alkyl radical having from 1 to 8 carbon atoms, for example TiCl4, TiCl3, (O-n-C3H7), TiCl2(O-n- C3H7)2, TiCl(O-n-C3H7)3, TiCl2(O-1-C3H)2, TiCl3(O-i- C3H7), TiCl3(O-CH2C6H5), TiCl2(O-CH2C6H5)2, TiCl 3(O-i-C4H9) and TiCl2(O-i-C4H9)2. Titanium tetrachloride, TiCl2(O-i-C3H)2 and TiCl 3(O-i-C3H7) are used preferably. The proportion between the titanium compound and 
 the solid carrier is chosen such that of from 0.01 to 1, preferably of from 0.05 to 1, especially of from 0.1 to 1, mol of titanium compound is used per 1 mole of hy droxyl groups of the solid carrier. The proportion of, Grignard compound to the tita 
 nium compound is chosen such that the atomic ratio of magnesium to titanium in the catalyst component A is in the range of from 0.01 to 10, preferably of from 0.05 to 5, especially of from 0.1 to 2. The catalyst component A thus obtained is used ei ther directly in the form of the suspension or after re 
 moval of the diluent and drying. Suitable compounds for the component B are organic 
 compounds of the metals selected from one of the main groups I, II and III of the periodic system. Aluminum organic compounds are preferably used as component 
 B. Suitable aluminum-organic compounds are the reac tion products of aluminum-trialkyls or aluminum dial kyl hydrides, containing alkyl radicals having from 1 to 
 16 carbon atoms, with dienes having from 4 to 20 car bon atoms. The reaction products of aluminum trialkyls or aluminum-dialkyl hydrides, the alkyl radicals of 
 which have from 4 to 8 carbon atoms, for example phellandrene of a diene of the formula "

 wherein R2 and R2 is hydrogen, an alkyl radical, an alkylene radical having a non-terminal double bond or a mononuclear aryl radical and a is 0 or 1, are used prefer ably. There may be mentioned, by way of example, 1,4-butadiene, isoprene, 2-phenyl butadiene, 1,4-pen tadiene, 1,3-pentadiene and myrcene. The reaction products of Al(i-C4H9)3 or Al(i-C4H9)2H with isoprene are used preferably. They comprise, for example, com pounds of the formula 
 R3 
 Z-A-R-Y-Z 
 wherein Y means the groups 
 R3 R4 R4 
 -Al-, - Al- crA 1-, o / N A. N / R4 
 Z is hydrogen, the isobutyl group, the dihydroisoprenyl group or an oligomer of this group, R is the isobutyl radical, R4 is the tetrahydroisoprenylene radical and n is an integer of from d1 to 20, the compounds of the for 
 mula 
 Al-R-Y-R 
 wherein Y, R3 and Rand n are defined as above. The ratio between C5 and C4 radicals in the reaction prod ucts of A1(i-C4H9)3 or A1(i-C4H9)2H with isoprene may generally be in the range of from 0.25 to 10, preferably 1 to 4. A compound of this type being commercially available under the name ""aluminum isoprenyl' is used particularly preferable. Further suitable compounds for component B are chlorine-containing aluminum-organic compounds, for example dialkyl aluminum monochlorides of the for mula R52AlCl or alkyl aluminum sesqui-chlorides of the formula R53Al2Cl3, wherein R5 is a hydrocarbon radical having from 1 to 16 carbon atoms, preferably an alkyl radical having from 1 to 16, especially from 2 to 12 carbon atoms. There may be mentioned, by way of example (C2H5)2AlCl, (i-C4H9)2AlCl, (C2H5)3Al2Cl3. Especially suitable compounds for the component B are aluminum trialkyls of the formula AllR3 or alumi num dialkyl hydrides of the formula AllR2H, wherein R5 is a hydrocarbon radical having from 1 to 16 carbon atoms, preferably an alkyl radical having from 1 to 16, especially from 2 to 4 carbon atoms, for example Al(C2H5)3, Al(C2H5)2H Al(C3H7)2H, Al(i-C4H9)3, Al(i- C4H9)2H. The conversion of the titanium(IV) compound of component A into the polymerization active compound having a lower valency is advantageously performed during the polymerization by the metallo-organic com pound (component B) at a temperature of from 20' to 150° C., preferably of from 60' to 140 C. Component A may also be treated with a metallo organic compound prior to polymerizing and be used subsequently in the polymerization at a temperature of 10

 from -30 to 150° C., preferably of from 0 to 100° C., with a molar ratio between metallo-organic compound and titanium compound of from 0.2:1 to 3:1, preferably from 0.5:1 to 2:1. If a chlorine-containing metallo organic compound is used it is advisable to wash the reaction product obtained with fresh dispersing agent. Thereafter it is activated with a further metallo-organic compound at a temperature of from 20 to 150 C. When using the catalyst according to the invention at least one 1-olefin of the formula R6-CH=CH2, wherein R6 is hydrogen or a straight chain or branched alkyl radical having from 1 to 10, preferably from 1 to 8, carbon atoms, is polymerized. Examples of such olefins are ethylene, propylene, butene-1, hexene-1, 4-methyl-pentene-1, octene-1. Ethylene is preferably 
 polymerized alone or as a mixture consisting of at least 70% by weight of ethylene and at most 30% by weight 
 of a further 1-olefin of the above formula. Ethylene is especially polymerized either alone or as a mixture of at least 92% by weight of ethylene and at most 8% by 
 weight of a further 1-olefin of the above formula. The molecular weight of the polymer is controlled in known manner, preferably by using hydrogen. The polymerization may be carried out in solution, in suspension or in the gaseous phase, continuously or 
 discontinuously, at a temperature of from 20 to 150 C., 
 preferably of from 60 to 140 C., under a pressure of from 0.5 to 50 bars. It is carried out preferably under the technically interesting pressure in the range of from 1 to 
 40 bars. 
 Thereby the titanium compound is used in a concen 
 tration of from 0.005 to 1.5, preferably of from 0.05 to 1, mmol per liter of dispersing agent or reactor volume. The metallo-organic compound is used in a concentra 
 tion of from 0.5 to 10 mmols, preferably of from 2 to 6 mmols, per liter of dispersing agent or reactor volume. Higher concentrations are also possible principally. The polymerization in suspension or solution is car 
 ried out in a conventional inert solvent for low pressure processes according to Ziegler, which have been de 
 scribed above. 
 The process according to the invention has the ad vantage that excessive metal compounds do not have to be removed from the catalyst component A by washing, owing to the fact that both the halogen-containing mag nesium-organic compound used and the halogen-con taining titanium(IV) compound react completely with the carrier. Consequently, no washing liquids are formed from which the metal compounds must be sepa rated prior to the secondary treatment. As a conse quence thereof there are formed no metal-containing waste water or slurries. During the polymerization of ethylene and higher 1-olefins the catalyst according to the invention gives high catalyst yields under low pres 
 sure, for example of from 1 to 7 bars, such that the magnesium/titanium and aluminum compound may 
 completely remain in the polymer; a discoloration of the polyolefin or corrosion phenomena on the processing machines do not occur. Thus expensive operations such as a decomposition of the catalyst and a removal of the catalyst may be dispensed with. Carrying out the poly merization under a higher pressure permits use of a still smaller quantity of catalyst, as the catalyst yield is highly improved with an increasing polymerization 
 pressure. The catalyst according to the invention is especially suitable for the polymerization of ethylene in the gase "

 ous phase in a fluidized bed. The use of oxide carriers having a particle size of more than 30 Jum, which may be obtained for example by separating fine particles by sieving, prevents finely divided catalysts or polymer 
 parts from being carried out of the fluidized bed and forming deposits in exterior zones of the reactor. The catalyst according to the invention permits prep aration of a polymer, the powder in bulk of which has a high air permeability and thus may directly be used in the processing by injection molding or extrusion with out previous granulation. A good air permeability of the powder in bulk in the extruder feeding zone prevents an incorporation of air into the molten polymer, which 
 would cause a formation of bubbles in the finished part. The porous silicon dioxide having one or more sur face OH groups is designated as ""silicic acid' in the examples. For determining the number of hydroxyl groups of 
 the carrier 10.0 g of the dried silicic acid are reacted under an argon atmosphere while refluxing and stirring with a solution of 500 mmols of n-propyl magnesium chloride in 500 ml of diethyl ether, for a period of 4 hours. After settling of the silicic acid magnesium is retitrated in the supernatant solution by way of com plexometry. The titanium content of component A is determined colorimetrically by using hydrogen peroxide (cf. G. O. 
 Muller, Praktikum der quantitativen chemischen Ana lyse, 4th edition, (1957), page 243). For the polymerization in suspension there is used a hydrated Diesel oil fraction having a boiling range of 
 from 140 to 200 C. 
 The melt index of the polymer is determined accord ing to DIN (German Industrial Standard) 53,735, at 190° C., by using a load of 5 kg for is and of 15 kg for i15. The reduced specific viscosity (RSV) is determined with a solution of decahydronaphthalene at 135 C. at a 
 concentration of 1 g/b 1. The bulk density is determined by weighing 100 cm of polyethylene powder. The air permeability is determined in the following manner: 100 cm3 of polyethylene powder are placed in a graduated cylinder, which has an inner diameter of 3 cm and a fritted glass bottom, and air suctioned through the powder at a rate of flow of 4 l/h; the pressure de crease occuring in the powder in bulk is determined. The air permeability is then determined in the following 
 nanner: 
 height of the package X flow velocity air permeability (L) = diameter of the cylinder X pressure loss. 
 In the present invention L is 0.023/A p - 1, whereby A p is millimeters of the water column and 1 mm water column corresponds to the pressure loss of the glass frit. The diamension of L is (cm . . sec/g). All solvents are distilled under an inert gas atmo sphere having a purity of at least 99.995% in a circula tion apparatus while passing over benzophenone potas sium and are withdrawn under an inert gas atmosphere. The preparation of the catalyst and the polymerization of ethylene are carried out under an argon atmosphere or under an atmosphere of purified nitrogen while care fully excluding air and humidity. The following examples illustrate the invention.

 particle size of 70 um is dried for 6 hours in a fluidized bed at 460 C. under an argon atmosphere and kept under an argon atmosphere. The number of hydroxyl groups is 1.7 mmols of hydroxy groups per 1 g of silicic 
 acid. 
 107 g of this silicic acid are suspended in 500 ml of nheptane under an argon atmosphere, 343 ml of a solu tion of 172 mmols of n-propyl magnesium chloride (1.6 mnols of magnesium per 1 g of silicic acid) in diethyl 
 ether are added and the mixture is heated for 4 hours to 
 50° C. The solvent is withdrawn thereafter in a rotary evaporator and the solid product is dried for 2 hours at 120° C. under 0.5 torr. Thereafter the solid product is suspended in 500 ml of n-heptane under an argon atmo 
 sphere, 20.3 g of titanium tetrachloride (1.0 mmol of titanium per 1 g of silicic acid) are added and the mix ture is stirred for 7 hours at 90° C. Heptane is thereafter withdrawn at 120° C. in the rotary evaporator under atmospheric pressure. 128 g of a flowable powder is 
 obtained. 
 The titanium analysis reveals 39.8 mg of titanium per 1 g of the component A. The atomic ratio of magnesi 
 um/titanium is 1.6:1. 
 500 ml of Diesel oil are introduced into a 1 liter auto 
 clave provided with a flat blade agitator, the air is dis placed by evacuating and introducing nitrogen under 
 pressure three times and the autoclave is heated to 85 C. 1.14 g of aluminum triethyl and 0.12 g of the catalyst component A are added. Hydrogen is then introduced until a pressure of 2 bars is attained and ethylene is 
 introduced in an amount sufficient to maintain a total 
 pressure of 5.9 bars. After 2 hours of polymerization at 85 C. the polyethylene powder is separated from the 
 dispersing agent by filtration and dried for 15 hours at 95° C. in vacuo. 115 g of polyethylene are obtained having an is value of 9.3 and a bulk density of 330g/1. The yield of polyethylene was 24,000 g per 1 g of titanium or 958g per 1 g of the catalyst component A. 
 EXAMPLE 2 
 Ethylene is polymerized in the presence of 0.22 g of the catalyst component A described in Example 1 under the same conditions as in Example 1, but by using in stead of aluminum triethyl 1.98 g of aluminum triisobu tyl. After 2 hours there are obtained 145g of polyethyl ene having a melt index is of 7.9 and a bulk density of 350 g/1. The RSV value is 1.84 g dl/g. There are ob tained per 1 gram of titanium 16,600 g of polyethylene and per gram of the catalyst component A, 659g. 
 EXAMPLE 3 
 Polymerization of ethylene in the gaseous phase. 2 kg of polyethylene (is = 10.8, bulk density 410 g/l) are introduced into a lying 80 liter reactor provided with a scraping stirrer. The reactor is liberated from air by evacuating several times and by flushing for several hours with an ethylene-hydrogen mixture and is heated thereafter to 90° C. 17.1 g of aluminum triethyl and 2.41 g of the catalyst component A prepared according to Example 1 are added. 2 kg of ethylene/hour and hydro 
 gen are introduced for a period of 6 hours until the hydrogen portion is 20% by volume. The polymeriza tion temperature is 95 C. The pressure mounts to 10.7 
 bars in the course of the reaction. There are obtained 14 
 kg of polyethylene having a melt index is of 0.95 and a bulk density of 435 g/l. A sieve analysis reveals a fine portion of 0.2% by weight below 100 pum and 0% by "

 weight below 50 m. 125,000 g of polyethylene per gram of titanium and 5,809 g of polyethylene per gram of the catalyst component A are obtained. 
 COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE A
