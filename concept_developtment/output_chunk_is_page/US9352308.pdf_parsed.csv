 SOLID CATALYST COMPONENT FOR 
 POLYMERIZATION AND 
 COPOLYMERIZATION OF ETHYLENE AND 
 PROCESS FOR OBTAINING THE SAME 
 This application is a Continuation-In-Part of application 
 Ser. No. 10/518,443 filed Jul. 1, 2005, now abandoned which 
 is the National phase of PCT International Application No. 
 PCT/BR2002/000086 filed on Jun. 19, 2002, all of which are hereby expressly incorporated by reference into the present application. 
 The present invention relates to a solid catalyst component 
 for ethylene polymerization and copolymerization, com 
 posed of a carrier of particulate silica and a catalytically active 
 portion including titanium, magnesium, chlorine, alkoxy 
 groups and at least one organometallic compound of the 
 groups 1, 2, 12 or 13 of the periodic table. The process for 
 producing the catalyst of the present invention comprises the 
 steps of: 
 (a) impregnating an activated silica particles with a solution 
 ofan organometallic compound of the groups 1, 2, 12 or 13 
 of the periodic table, in an inert organic solvent; (b) removing the Supernatant liquid from the step (a): 
 (c) preparing a solution obtained by reacting at least one magnesium compound, selected from magnesium halides 
 and magnesium alkoxides and at least one titanium com 
 pound selected from titanium alkoxides and titanium halo gen alkoxides; 
 (d) impregnating the silica obtained in (b) using the Solution prepared in (c); 
 (e) optionally reacting the solid obtained in (d) with a reduc ing agent; 
 (f) reacting the solid obtained in (d) or (e) with a halogenating 
 agent, 
 (g) thermally treating the Solid obtained in (f); 
 (h) washing the Solid obtained in (g) with an inert organic 
 solvent; 
 (i) optionally, washing the Solid obtained in (h) with a solu tion of one or more organometallic compounds of the 
 groups 1, 2, 12 or 13 of the periodic table. The catalyst component obtained is especially suitable for the production of homo- and copolymers of ethylene as nar 
 row molecular weight distribution high density polyethylene 
 and linear low density polyethylene with controlled morphol 
 ogy and improved structure. 
 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 
 1) Polymerization Process 
 The slurry or gas phase processes for the production of 
 HDPE or LLDPE operating with low bulk density polymers 
 require reactors with large Volumes in order to obtain the necessary residence time. Particularly, in the gas phase reac 
 tors, the presence offines with low bulk density causes prob 
 lems. In fact, due to the friction of the polymer particles present in the reactor, the fines are especially prone to the 
 formation of electrostatic charges and tend to deposit and adhere to the metallic walls. These stagnant deposits do not 
 allow the exchange of the reaction heat and become hot spots, which can form layers of agglomerates containing eventually 
 melt polymer. After a period of time chunks of agglomerates can fall down and plug the product discharge system. The 
 described effects are enhanced when the reaction is carried 
 out with a highly active catalyst. 
 In U.S. Pat. No. 5,410.002 a summary of patents on the above described phenomena is presented. 10

 Therefore, it is crucial for the process that the catalyst used 
 enables a total control of the polymer morphology resulting in 
 product grains without fines, with high bulk density and good flowing properties. 
 Another very important aspect is that the catalyst must 
 have a slow decaying time to permit the use of reactors in 
 series. This arrangement makes possible the obtainment of 
 bimodal products in addition to the reduction of the total 
 volume of the reaction for the same production basis. More 
 over, process operations with a different condition of reaction 
 in at least two reactors in series, makes possible the use of catalysts with higher particle size thereby minimizing the 
 formation of electrostatic charges. 
 2) Polymer Structure 
 The catalyst properties are fundamental to the polymer 
 structure, mainly with respect to the molecular weight distri 
 bution, comonomer insertion in the polymeric chain and 
 soluble content. 
 Each application used to achieve a final product from high 
 density polyethylene (HDPE) or linear low density polyeth 
 ylene (LLDPE) requires a specific polymeric structure. 
 To obtain a film with improved optical and mechanical properties and avoid blocking problems, a polymer having a 
 narrow molecular weight distribution (MFR<27), is required. A large quantity of LLDPE applications requires products 
 with a density=0.918 and a MI=0.7, and in most cases a 
 xylene soluble content<10% is desired. Indeed, when the Xylene soluble content of the polymer is present in a high 
 concentration (>10%) and with a low molecular weight, this soluble content tends to migrate to the film Surface causing blocking, in addition to the unsatisfactory optical properties 
 (low gloss and high haze). 3) Ziegler-Natta Polyethylene Catalyst 
 Due to the strong competition existent in the polyethylene 
 market, the catalyst production cost is a fundamental compo 
 nent. Therefore it is mandatory that the catalyst for producing 
 polyethylene be manufactured by a simple route, from low 
 cost raw material, without generating gaseous, liquid or Solid 
 effluents which are hard to treat. 
 U.S. Pat. No. 5,188,997 describes a synthesis process for Ziegler-Natta catalysts from silica and magnesium chloride 
 alcoholate. The results reported demonstrate that this catalyst produces a polymer with low bulk density (0.23 to 0.30 g/ml) 
 and with an intermediate molecular weight distribution (MFR 
 30.0 to 37.8). U.S. Pat. No. 5,585,317 describes the synthesis of a cata lyst Supported on a magnesium chloride based carrier. The reported examples relates to the production of polymers hav 
 ing good morphology, characterized by the absence of fines 
 and by the high bulk density which is, for LLDPE, produced 
 between 0.32 and 0.40 g/ml and for HDPE, between 0.33 and 0.438 g/ml. 
 However, in the case of LLDPE production, the polymer 
 obtained presents an undesired comonomer distribution in its 
 chain, evidenced by the high xylene soluble content at differ ent polymer densities. As an example, a polyethylene with 
 0.919 g/ml of polymer density has a xylene soluble content of 12.5% by weight. 
 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 
 The present invention relates to a solid catalyst component for ethylene polymerization and copolymerization, com 
 posed of a carrier of particulate silica and a catalytically active portion including titanium, magnesium, chlorine, alkoxy 
 groups and at least one organometallic compound of the "

 groups 1, 2, 12 or 13 of the periodic table. The process for 
 producing the catalyst of the present invention comprises the 
 steps of: 
 (a) impregnating activated silica particles with a solution of an organometallic compound of the groups 1, 2, 12 or 13 of 5 
 the periodic table, in an inert organic solvent;

 (c) preparing a solution obtained by reacting at least one

 and magnesium alkoxides and at least one titanium com 
 pound selected from titanium alkoxides and titanium halo 
 gen alkoxides;

 (e) optionally reacting the Solid obtained in (d) with a reduc ing agent; 
 (f) reacting the solid obtained in (d) or (e) with a halogenating 
 agent, 
 (g) thermally treating the Solid obtained in (f); 2O 
 (h) washing the Solid obtained in (g) with an inert organic 
 solvent; 
 (i) optionally, washing the Solid obtained in (h) with a solu 
 tion of one or more metal-alkyl halide compounds of the 
 groups 1, 2, 12 or 13 of the periodic table. 25 
 Therefore, the present invention provides a catalyst espe 
 cially suitable for the production of ethylene homo- and 
 copolymers with a narrow molecular weight distribution, 
 high density polyethylene (NMWHDPE) and a linear low 
 density polyethylene (LLDPE) with controlled morphology 
 and improved structure. 
 Additionally, the catalyst described and claimed in the 
 present invention produces a NMWHDPE with a melt flow 
 ratio (MFR) lower than 27 that is particularly suitable for thermoforming and injection applications. 
 Further, the catalyst described and claimed in the present 
 invention produces a LLDPE with a low xylene soluble con 
 tent due to the very good comonomer insertion allowing the production of films with Superior optical properties and very 40 
 low blocking. 
 The present invention further defines a catalyst that pro 
 vides, when Submitted to polymerization conditions, par ticles of polyethylene and ethylene copolymers having a high 
 bulk density and containing a very Small quantity of fines. 45 
 The present invention additionally provides a catalyst use 
 ful in liquid phase or in gas phase, ethylene polymerization 
 processes. 
 The present invention further provides a catalyst useful in 
 polymerization processes due to its high activity and low

 over a period from 1 to 20 hours. The amount of remaining 
 OH on the silica surface after this treatment ranges from 0.1 to 2 mmoles OH per g of silica, preferably between 0.5 and

 Other silicon compounds useful as reducing agents in the 
 practice of this invention are: silanes (SiH, in which m is a number equal to or higher than 1), alkyl-silanes or aryl 
 silanes (RSiH, in which Risalkyl oraryland X is a number varying from 1 to 3) and alkoxy-silanes or aryloxy-silanes 
 (RO, SiH, in which R is alkyl or aryl and x is a number 
 varying from 1 to 3). 
 The reducing agent chosen from the above examples, pref 
 erably polymethylhydrosiloxanes (PMHS), is added to the 
 solid obtained in the step (d), dissolved preferably in the same 
 inert organic solvent used for the reaction Suspension. This 
 addition is carried out slowly over a period of time from 30 to 
 180 minutes, preferably between 50 and 80 minutes and the Solid Suspension is maintained under stirring at a temperature 
 ranging from room temperature to the boiling point of the 
 aliphatic hydrocarbon used as solvent, preferably at 60° C. 
 The amount of reducing agent that can be used in step (e) 
 corresponds to the amount ranging from 0 to 2 moles per mole 
 of titanium, preferably between 0 and 0.1 mole per mole of 
 titanium. It has been observed, in the experiments, that the 
 quantity used of this reducing agent can control the amount of 
 titanium fixed on silica at the final catalyst. In the next step of the process according to the present 
 invention, the Suspension obtained in (d) or (e), which is still under stirring, is put in contact and interacted with one or more halogenating agents. 
 Halogenating agents useful in the practice of the present 
 invention can be either liquid or gaseous materials, pure or preferably dissolved in an inert organic solvent. Representa 
 tive but non-exhaustive examples of halogenating agents use 
 ful in the present invention are methylaluminum dichloride, methylaluminum sesquichloride, isobutylaluminum dichlo 
 ride, isobutylaluminum sesquichloride, ethylaluminum 
 dichloride (EADC), diethylaluminum chloride (DEAC), ethylaluminum sesquichloride (EASC), SiCl, SnCl4, HCl, 
 Cl, HSiCl, aluminum chloride, ethylboron dichloride, boron chloride, diethylboron chloride, HCC1, PC1, POCl, acetyl chlorides, thionyl chloride, sulfur chloride, methyl 
 trichlorosilane, dimethyl dichlorosilane, TiCl, VC1, CC1, t-butyl chloride, n-butyl chloride, chloroform, 1,1,1-trichlo 
 roethane, 1.1.2-trichloroethane, 1,2-dichloroethane and 
 dichloromethane. 
 The preferred halogenating agents are chlorinating agents 
 and of these SiCl, SnCl4, HCl, Cl, HSiCl, methyl trichlo rosilane, dimethyl dichlorosilane, t-butyl chloride, n-butyl 
 chloride, chloroform, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, 1,1,2-trichloro 
 ethane, 1,2-dichloroethane and dichloromethane are pre ferred, most preferably SiCl The amount of halogenating agent used in the step (f) of the process corresponds to the amount ranging from 0.5 to 3 moles of halogenating agent per mole of titanium, preferably 
 between 1 and 1.8 moles of halogenating agent per mole of 
 titanium. 
 The time necessary for halogenating Ti-alkoxide and optionally Mg-alkoxide varies from 0.5 hour to 5 hours, pref 
 erably from 1.5 hours to 2.5 hours. The temperature of the Solid Suspension halogenation ranges from room temperature 
 to the boiling point of the aliphatic hydrocarbon used as 
 solvent, preferably at 60° C. According to the present invention, in step (g) of the pro 
 cess, the Solid obtained in (f) is kept under higher temperature 
 that depends on the inert organic solvent used. 
 The time necessary for this thermal treatment of the solid obtained in step (f) ranges from 0.5 hour to 5 hours, preferably from 3 to 5 hours. The ideal temperature for this purpose 
 depends on the organic solvent used and it can be conducted 5

 from 60° C. to 120° C., preferably from 60°C. to 75°C., when hexane is used as the organic solvent. 
 At the step (h) after the thermal treatment, the solid can be separated from the Suspension, for example by settling and 
 siphoning, filtration or centrifugation, washed with an inert 
 organic solvent, preferably hexane, and then dried. The wash ing temperature can vary from room temperature to the boil 
 ing point of the aliphatic hydrocarbon used as solvent, pref erably at room temperature. 
 Optionally, the solid obtained in (h) is washed with a solu tion of organometallic compounds of the groups 1, 2, 12 or 13. 
 More specifically, in the optional step (i) the solid obtained in 
 step (h) is suspended in an inert organic solvent such as 
 hexane or heptane, and it is put in contact with one or more organometallic compounds of the groups 1, 2, 12 or 13 of the periodic table, preferably metal-alkyl compounds or metal 
 alkylhalide compounds belonging to these groups, in special 
 aluminum, magnesium, lithium and Zinc compounds. Spe cific examples of these compounds are methylaluminum 
 dichloride, methylaluminum sesquichloride, isobutylalumi 
 num dichloride, isobutylaluminum sesquichloride, ethylalu 
 minum dichloride (EADC), diethylaluminum chloride (DEAC), ethylaluminum sesquichloride (EASC), tri-n-hexy 
 laluminum (Tn-HAL), tri-n-octylaluminum (TnOAL). They 
 can be used concentrated or preferably dissolved in the above organic solvent or in a different organic solvent chosen from aliphatic hydrocarbons. The process is carried out at a tem perature ranging from room temperature to the boiling point 
 of the organic solvent used as solvent, preferably at room temperature, for a period of time that can vary from 10 min 
 utes to 24 hours, preferably from 40 minutes to 5 hours. When using more than one organometallic compound in 
 the step (i), the different compounds can be fed in the same 
 Solution or in individual Solutions, at the same time or in Subsequent additions. 
 The amount of the metal-alkyl halide compound of the groups 1, 2, 12 or 13 or metal-alkyl compound of the groups 
 1, 2, 12 or 13, used in the step (i) of the process corresponds 
 to the amount ranging from 0 to 3 g of the corresponding metal-alkyl halide compound of the groups 1, 2, 12 or 13 or 
 metal-alkyl compound of the groups 1, 2, 12 or 13, per g of 
 dry catalyst component obtained, preferably between 0.05 and 1 g of the corresponding metal-alkylhalide compound of 
 the groups 1, 2, 12 or 13 or metal-alkyl compound of the groups 1, 2, 12 or 13, per g of dry catalyst component 
 obtained. 
 The use of inert organic solvents, most specifically ali phatic hydrocarbons, in all process steps of the present inven 
 tion brings another important feature to the Solid catalyst 
 component characteristics. The Solid catalyst component 
 obtained is completely free of residual polar solvents, such as 
 ethanol, and their derivatives in its final composition. 
 The titanium amount that remains fixed on the Solid cata 
 lyst component may reach up to 10% by weight, expressed as 
 the Timetal content, and it is preferably comprised between 0.5 and 2% by weight. 
 The magnesium amount that remains fixed on the Solid catalyst component may reach up to 6% by weight, expressed 
 as the Mg metal content, and it is preferably comprised 
 between 0.3 and 3.0% by weight. 
 The chlorine amount that remains fixed on the solid cata 
 lyst component may reach up to 20% by weight, expressed as 
 the C1 contents, and it is preferably between 5 and 12% by weight. 
 The alkoxy amount that remains fixed on the Solid catalyst component may reach up to 20% by weight and it is prefer 
 ably between 3 and 8% by weight. "

 The amount of organometallic compound of the groups 1, 
 2, 12 or 13 that remains fixed on the solid catalyst component may reach up to 5% by weight, expressed as the metal con 
 tents, and it is preferably between 0.3 and 3% by weight. This organometallic compound of the groups 1, 2, 12 or 13 are metal-alkyl compounds or metal-alkyl halide compounds belonging to these groups, in special organoaluminum, orga 
 nomagnesium, organolithium and organozinc compounds, 
 pure or in mixtures. The particle size distribution of the solid catalyst compo 
 nent of the present invention is very close to the silica used as carrier and, as consequence, its average particle size ranges 
 also from 10 to 120 um. The solid catalyst component surface area ranges from 80 to 300 m/g and its pore volume ranges 
 from 0.1 to 1.0 ml/g. The catalyst component of the present invention is Suitable for using in liquid phase or gas phase, ethylene polymeriza 
 tion process. The co-catalyst used in the polymerization pro 
 cess is an alkyl-aluminum, preferably trimethyl aluminum or 
 triethyl aluminum. The mass ratio co-catalyst:catalyst in the polymerization process is between 0.5:1 and 6.0:1. 
 An important feature is its ability to produce, when sub 
 mitted to polymerization conditions, particles of homo and copolymers of ethylene with controlled morphology having 
 high bulk density and containing a very Small quantity of 
 fines. This feature allows the use of this catalyst in a process where the catalyst can be fed directly into the polymerization 
 reactor. Particular forms to feed the catalyst are in dry bulk powder, in paste, in oil Suspension or in solvent Suspension. 
 As an alternative the catalyst can be prepolymerized with 
 ethylene or propylene and optionally with a comonomer 
 before being fed into the reactor. Another important feature of the present invention is its tolerance to the high electrostatic charges occurring in gas 
 phase reactors. This feature helps to prevent the formation of 
 polymer sheets or agglomerates on the reactor walls. The 
 good catalytic yield and the low decay kinetics observed for 
 the present invention, allows its use in most polymerization processes, including processes operating in more than one 
 reactor in series. 
 A further feature characteristic of the catalyst of the present invention is when using a microspheroidal silica as Support 
 the catalyst obtained has also a spheroidal morphology and in consequence a polymer product with good morphology and 
 flowability is obtained. 
 The catalyst component of the present invention is advan tageously used in the polymerization of ethylene and mix 
 tures thereof with alpha-olefins CH2=CHR, wherein R is an alkyl or cicloalkyl or aryl radical with 1-12 carbon atoms 
 because it has a high activity and low decay kinetics. In particular, it is used in the preparation of: High density polyethylenes (HDPE, having a density greater than 0.940 g/cm), particularly with narrow 
 molecular weight distribution (MFR-27), including homopolymers of ethylene and copolymers of ethylene 
 with one or more alpha-olefins having from 3 to 14 
 carbon atoms. These products are particularly Suitable for thermoforming and injection applications; 
 Linear medium density and linear low density polyethyl 
 enes (LMDPE and LLDPE, having a density lower than 0.940 g/cm) most specifically very low and ultra low 
 density linear polyethylenes (VLDPE and ULDPE, hav ing a density lower than 0.920 g/cm and as low as 0.880 g/m) consisting of copolymers of ethylene with one or 
 more alpha-olefins having from 3 to 14 carbon atoms, having a content of units derived from ethylene greater than approximately 80% by weight. These products 10

 have an improved structure due to the very good 
 comonomer insertion and, in most cases, they have also 
 a narrow molecular weight distribution (MFR-27). 
 Hence the low xylene soluble contents are obtained, allowing the production of films with superior optical 
 properties and very low blocking. The LMDPE products are particularly useful for rotomolding applications; 
 Elastomeric copolymers of ethylene and propylene and 
 elastomeric terpolymers of ethylene and propylene with 
 minor amounts of a diene, having a content of units derived from ethylene comprised between about 30 and 70% by weight.

 Make-up components are fed to the system at spot 8 so as 
 to make up the composition of recycle stream 5. So, make-up 
 stream 8 will include the triethyl aluminum (TEAL) that 
 directly reacts in a ratio of 2 moles of TEAL per mole of 
 catalyst. Also at the spot 8, propane is fed as the selected 
 non-reactive compound required to maintain the total pres 
 Sure of the system. 
 The polymerization catalyst is introduced as a dry powder 
 by a catalyst feeder into reactor 1 in a site within the reaction Zone 3, close to the distributing plate 9 in a rate to control the residence time of the catalyst. The reactive gases, including 
 ethylene and comonomers are introduced at the spot 10. 60

 The produced polymer is discharged from the reaction Zone through a discharge system 11 that provides the recovery 
 of the reactive and non-reactive gases, recycling said gases back to the recycle stream 5 at spot 12 and lowers the pressure of the discharged mixture of polymer and gases at certain pressure for later conveying the produced polymer particles 
 13 for downward sampling. 
 Examples 13 to 23 
 The examples 13 to 23 were conducted in the gas phase pilot reactor at 88°C., using in each EXAMPLE respectively the catalysts produced in the EXAMPLES 1 to 10. The cata lyst produced in the EXAMPLE 10 was also used in the pilot polymerization at 75° C. as shown in the EXAMPLE 23. In all examples the pilot reactor run was performed Smoothly, with good catalytic yield and no agglomerates or 
 sheets were formed. The polymers obtained had a good mor 
 phology and, in most cases, less than 1% of fines (<250 um). The films obtained with these polymers presented very good optical properties and a low blocking strength. 
 During the performance of the EXAMPLE 20 it was per 
 formed a decay test and the measured half-life time was 3.8 
 hours.
