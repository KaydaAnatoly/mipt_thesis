         "5,461.018 \n 1 \n PROCATALYST COMPOST ON FOR THE \n POLYMERIZATION OF ALPHA-OLEFINES, \n PREPARATION AND USE \n This application is a continuation of application Ser. No. \n 07/853,733, filed as PCT/FI90/00287, Nov. 27, 1990, now \n abandoned. The present invention relates to a procatalyst composi tion which is suitable for homo and copolymerization of \n O-olefines. \n The invention also relates to a method for preparing such a procatalyst composition and to its use jointly with an organometallic cocatalyst compound for the polymerization \n of O-olefines. Generally the Ziegler-Natta catalyst system is used for the polymerization of olefines. This system consists of a so-called procatalyst and a cocatalyst. The procatalyst is a component which is based on a compound of a transition metal of any of the groups IVB-VIII of the periodic table of elements. The cocatalyst, again, is a component based on an organometallic compound of a metal of any of the groups \n IA-IIIA of the periodic table of elements. Generally, electron donor compounds improving and modifying the catalytic properties also belong to the catalyst system. 10 \n 15 \n 20 \n When preparing heterogenic polymerization catalysts, it . \n is usual to use a carrier compound as the component improving the polymerization activity of the procatalysts, \n the transition metal compound being layered onto this carrier compound. Usual carrier compounds are based on \n silicon dioxide, aluminium oxide, magnesium oxide, tita \n nium oxide, their mixtures, carbon in various forms, and different kinds of polymers. Magnesium compounds, such as alkoxides, hydroxides, hydroxy halogenides and halo genides have proved to be important carrier compounds, and the latter, magnesium chloride in particular, have lately become the major carrier components of procatalyst com positions. As magnesium compounds and especially magnesium \n halogenides are not, in their basic crystal form, activated very efficiently by a transition metal compound, their crystal \n structure has to be deformed. \n Conventionally, the deformation of the crystal structure is carried out e.g. by grinding in a ball mill, whereby the typical results is a finely-divided powder having a large \n specific surface, in which the crystal lattices of the particles are strongly deformed. The usual grinding method however has the disadvantage of consuming extremely much energy, \n of causing wear and corrosion in the equipment and of being good for the preparation of a catalyst only by a laborious \n batch process. \n A more modern way of providing a deformed crystal structure of a magnesium compound like magnesium halo genide, and thus of increasing its activability by transition metal compounds, is to modify it chemically. The magne \n sium compound, the possible electron donor and the tran sition metal compound are then mutually reacted, often in a solution, into easily isolated procatalyst compositions. How \n ever, the method does not provide sufficient amorphous procatalyst composition, while the composition is crystal \n lised during the preparation more or less spontaneously and does not subsequently alter its morphology essentially. \n A third means of providing a deformed or amorphous crystal structure of a magnesium compound is layering the magnesium compound, the transition metal compound and \n optionally an electron donor on an essentially inert carrier agent. Such a method has been described in the following specifications, among others. \n The U.S. Pat. No. 4,363,746 describes as one of its 25 \n 30 \n 35 \n 40 \n 45 \n 50 \n 55 \n 60 \n 65 2 \n embodiments reacting of untreated silica with a complex of \n magnesium chloride and transition metal alcoholate, react ing of the product obtained with an organoaluminium com pound, like organoaluminium halogenide, and eventually \n activation of the solid intermediate product obtained with a transition metal halogenide. \n The same technique is represented by the U.S. Pat. No. 4,391,736, relating to the removal of surface hydroxyles of a carrier agent of silica type by means of an organometallic compound, such as organoaluminium halogenide, reacting \n of the hydroxy-free carrier obtained with a complex of magnesium dihalogenide tetra-alkyl titanate and activating \n the solid reaction product obtained with titanium tetrahalo genide. \n The WO patent application 89/02446 describes the dry ing of silica and removal of its surface hydroxyles by means of an agent reacting with hydroxyle such as a halogenide or an organosilica compound, bringing the agent pretreated in \n this manner into contact with an organomagnesium com pound like an alkoxy magnesium compound, further react ing of the produced intermediate product with an organoti tanium compound or an organotitanate and finally treating \n the product with titanium halogenide. The GB patent specification 2 102 438 describes the dissolving of a magnesium halogenide in a titanium alkoxide compound in heptane, crystallizing of the mixture with a polymeric silicon compound and using the powder thus \n obtained as a catalyst carrier, which is activated by a liquid titanium compound containing halogen. \n The four specifications above describe the preparation of a solid procatalyst composition in two titanization steps, \n which are very difficult and sensitive to impurities, among \n others. \n The U.S. Pat. No. 4,530,913 and 4,578,440 disclose the \n treatment of the hydroxylic surface of a silica or aluminium oxyde carrier with a halogen-free organosilica compound, \n the treatment of the reaction product obtained with an organometallic compound, which is based on magnesium or \n magnesium and aluminium, and eventually activation of the reaction product with a transition metal compound, the two latter steps being interchangeable. \n The EP patent specification 123510 describes the drying \n of silica or aluminium oxyde and the removal of their surface hydroxyles by means of an organosilica compound, \n the reacting of the treated silica or aluminium oxyde with an organometallic compound, which is based on magnesium or \n magnesium and aluminium, and finally activation of the reaction product with a transition metal compound. The three last-mentioned specifications have the disad vantage of using an organometallic compound as a magne \n sium compound, which does not in itself contain the halogen required for forming a complex having catalyst activity. In \n order to achieve catalytically activating interaction between \n the magnesium and the transition metal, the use of a tran sition metal halogenide like titanium tetrachloride or tita nium alkoxy chloride is required. The sensitivity of such a reagent e.g. to air humidity greatly hampers the activation of \n the carrier agent. The EP patent application 45969 describes the solving of magnesium chloride and titanium tetraethoxyde in hexane \n and the crystallization of the mixture with ethyl aluminium sesquichloride. After decantation, the deposit is elutriated in hexane, prepolymerized with ethene and is treated once more with ethyl aluminium sesquichloride and titanium \n tetrachloride. The catalyst obtained was used together with triethyl aluminium in the preparation of polyethene. The process of this specification has the disadvantage of an "

The purpose of the present invention is to provide a procatalyst composition that is as active as possible. A solid procatalyst composition should also have a suitable particle shape, size and granulometric distribution. These purposes \n should be achieved with a minimum of effort and without the \n above inconvenients. \n The problem has now been solved by a new procatalyst composition intended for the polymerization of alfa-ole \n fines. The composition is mainly characterized by the facts mentioned in the characterizing part of claim 1. Thus, it has been discovered that a practicable procatalyst composition is \n easily provided in the following manner. When a carrier agent based on at least one inorganic oxide is set up, having on its surface some or no hydroxyle groups, and then the carrier agent is treated with a magnesium compound and one \n or more transition metal compounds of the groups IVB and VB of the periodic table into which the magnesium com pound is dissolved, and finally a step is carried out, in which the reaction product or mixture of the carrier agent, the magnesium compound and the transition metal compound or \n compounds are contacted and reacted with a chlorination reagent not containing transition metals, a procatalyst is \n obtained, which has an optimal chlorine-metal balance in terms of the polymerization result. \n The advantage of this invention compared to solutions known in prior art is an easy and simple catalyst preparation method; no time-consuming washing and drying steps are \n needed and thus the waste amount produced during the catalyst preparation is minimal. \n The advantage compared to the U.S. Pat. No. 4.391,736, the catalyst according to the present invention has a good hydrogen sensitivity, a good activity and a good comonomer \n sensitivity. In addition, the polymers obtained have a narrow molecule weight distribution. The advantage compared to the solutions of the patent applications GB 2 102438 and EP 45969 A1 is the controlled morphology of the catalyst according to this invention, due to the carrier agent, espe cially silicon dioxide. Implementing a solution of magnesium compound and \n transition metal compound for the treatment of the carrier agent thus surprisingly makes a second and separate acti vation step with the transition metal compound superfluous, \n and a mere chlorination will be sufficient. Suitable transition \n metal compounds are liquid compounds that dissolve mag \n nesium compounds. Such compounds are for instance vana \n dium oxitrichloride and transition metal alkoxides, such as titanium tetra-alkoxides, advantageously titanium tetrabu \n toxide. \n A second advantage of the supplementary final chlori \n nation step is that instead of an organomagnesium com pound magnesium halogenide, advantageously magnesium \n dichloride, can be used as magnesium compound, thus \n gaining benefit from its structure in order to achieve a procatalyst composition that is as active as possible. \n The carrier agent used in the invention can be any porous inorganic or organic substance. We cite polymers among the oganic carrier agents. Especially advantageous are carrier \n agents based on oxides of silicon, aluminium, titanium, magnesium and/or chromium. Such carrier agents are e.g. silicon oxide, aluminium oxide, magnesium-oxide, magne sium silicate, titanium oxide, etc. Especially advantageous \n carrier agents are silicon oxide, aluminium oxide and mag \n nesium silicate or a mixture of them. A silicon dioxide \n product is the most advantageous of all. \n It is advantageous to set up such an inert carrier agent, in 10 \n 15 \n 20 \n 25 \n 30 \n 35 \n 40 \n 45 \n 50 \n 55 \n 60 \n 65 4 \n which hydroxyle groups have been removed thermally and/ or chemically from the surface of the inorganic oxide. At temperatures below 200° C., thc thermal treatment involves water removal and at higher temperatures calcina tion of the surface hydroxyles. The thermal treatment advan tageously takes place at a temperature of c. 100-1000° C. The surface hydroxyle groups of the carrier agent are removed chemically by using substances reactive with hydroxyle groups. Such substances are organic silicon, aluminium, zinc, phosphor and/or fluorine compounds. We can mention among appropriate organic silicon compounds as preferable the compounds of the formula (RSi)NH or the formula RSiX in which R is a hydrogen and/or alkyle group, X is a group reacting with the H of the hydroxyle group, like halogen, and n is 1, 2 or 3. Among preferable organic aluminium compounds can be \n mentioned the compounds of the formula \n in which R is hydrogen and/or a hydrocarbon group con taining 1-20 carbon atoms, preferably a lower alkyle group, \n X is halogen, n is 1, 2 or better 3, and m is 1 or 2. Typical aluminium compounds are trialkyl aluminium such as tri isobutyle aluminium, dialkyle aluminium halogenide such as diethyle aluminium chloride and dialkyle aluminium hydride such as diisobutyle aluminium hydride. Advantageous phosphor compounds removing hydroxyle \n groups are phosphorous trihalogenides, phosphorous oxitri halogenides, dialkyle phosphorous halogenides, monoalkyle \n phosphorous halogenides and diamino-phosphorous oxiha logenides. Appropriate fluorine compounds removing \n hydroxyle groups are fluoric gas, fluoric hydrogen, boron \n trifluoride, silicon tetrafluoride and sulphur oxide fluoride. The most advantageous substances removing hydroxyle \n groups are organic silicon compounds and organic alu \n minium compounds and among these, respectively, the most advantageous are hexamethyl disilaZane (CH)Si NH and triethyl aluminium (CH)Al. At least the majority of hydroxyle groups having been \n removed from the surface of the carrier agent, it will be treated with a magnesium compound and one or more of thc transition metal compounds of groups IVB and VB of the periodic system of elements, into which the magnesium compound is dissolvable. This may take place by first adding the magnesium compound and subsequently the transition metal compound, \n or vice versa. However, it is advantageous to contact a carrier agent containing a few or no surface hydroxyles with a mixture formed of a magnesium compound and one or \n more compounds of a transition metal of the groups IVB and VB of the periodic table of elements. Thc mixture is advantageously in the state of a solution, in particular of a hydrocarbon solution, the dissolved substance being possi bly a complex of a magnesium compound and a transition \n metal compound. As mentioned above, the preferable mag nesium compound is magnesium chloride and the preferable transition metal compound is tetra-alkyl titanate (titanium \n tetra-alkoxide) such as tetrabutyl titanate. A vanadium com pound, preferably VOCl, can be used as a transition mctal compound. \n When the carrier agent containing a few or no surface hydroxyles has been treated with a magnesium compound \n and one or more transition metal compounds, the reaction product or mixture of the compounds is contacted and \n reacted with a chlorination reagent free from transition metals. If necessary, this chlorination can bc carricci out directly after the removal of the hydroxyle groups of the "

Typical aluminium compounds good for chlorination are alkyl aluminium chlorides, such as diethyl aluminium chlo ride, ethyl aluminium sesquichloride and ethyl aluminium dichloride. The entire group of precatalysts can be chlori nated together or in smaller batches in a separate vessel before the polymerization reactor addition. The amount of precatalyst to be used in the polymerization can be chlori nated into a finished procatalyst composition in the poly \n merization reactor, before adding the cocatalyst. \n The invention also relates to a method for preparing a procatalyst composition of the above type, in which one or \n more inert solid inorganic carriers are treated, from which the surface hydroxyle groups have been removed thermally or chemically totally or partly by reacting the carrier with the compound removing hydroxyle groups, \n a) by impregnating the carrier with a mixture of the Mg compound and one or more compounds of a transition \n metal of the group IVB or VB of the periodic table of elements, which dissolves the Mg compound, and \n b) by chlorinating with a compound not containing tita \n nium so that \n 1) the carrier agent is first treated with a mixture in the state of a solution of the Mg compound and the transition metal compound and the product thus \n obtained is chlorinated, and \n 2) the carrier agent is first chlorinated and subsequently \n treated with the above mixture in the form of a solution, \n O \n 3) the Mg compound and the transition metal compound are impregnated into the carrier agent without any separate dissolving and the product thus obtained is \n chlorinated. \n The same definitions as the ones for the catalyst compo \n sition defined by means of the method are valid for the method of the invention. The method is typically accom plished e.g. by removing the water from one or more inorganic oxides by drying or calcinating at 150-1000 C. and/or chemically with an organic silicon compound, advan tageously with hexamethyl disilaZane. The premixture is prepared by dissolving a magnesium compound, preferably an anhydrous magnesium chloride, \n into a transition metal compound dissolving this such as titanium alkoxide, preferably titanium tetrabutoxide, at a temperature above 20° C. A hydrocarbon dissolvant may be \n added to the solution either before or after the dissolving of the magnesium compound. \n The molar ratio Ti/Mg is at least 1, advantageously at least \n 2. \n The molar ratio Cl/Ti is c. 1-10, more advantageously \n c.3-5 and most advantageously c.4. The premixture is added dropwise into a carrier agent that is essentially free of surface hydroxyles, which remains as a liquid powder throughout the addition. The carrier agent can also be elutriated into hydrocarbon before adding the pre \n mixture. The mixture formed of the premixture and the carrier agent is stirred for 1-100 hours at room or a higher \n temperature. \n The components of the premixture can be added into the 10 \n 15 \n 20 \n 25 \n 30 \n 35 \n 40 \n 45 \n 50 \n 55 \n 60 \n 65 6 \n carrier agent without a separate dissolving so that a mag nesium compound, a hydrocarbon dissolvant and a titanium compound are mixed into the carrier compound in any order, \n after which the precatalyst mixture is stirred for 1-100 hours at room or a higher temperature. \n The preprocatalyst obtained is chlorinated with a com pound free of titanium by adding the chlorinating compound either directly into the dry preprocatalyst powder or a hydrocarbon slurry of the preprocatalyst. Alkyl aluminium \n chlorides, ethyl aluminium sesquichloride and ethyl alu \n minium dichloride are suitable chlorine compounds. The chlorinating compound can be added to the carrier agent \n either before the addition of premixture or after it. \n The present invention also relates to the use of the procatalyst composition of the invention for the homo- or copolymerization of alfa-olefines, in which the polymeriza tion is accomplished with the aid of the above procatalyst composition and an organometallic cocatalyst compound of \n any of the groups IA-IIA of the periodic table of elements. The cocatalyst compound is advantageously an organometal \n compound of aluminium, such as trialkyl aluminium, more advantageously triethyl aluminium. \n If necessary, an electron donor can be used in the pro catalyst composition of the invention. In addition to the procatalyst composition and the cocatalyst, a so-called \n external electron donor can be used in the polymerization. \n The invention is described below with the aid of a number \n of examples. \n PREPARATION OF THE CATALYST \n Example 1 \n A. Preparation of the Premixture Into 386 mg of anhydrous magnesium dichloride, 2.8 ml \n of titanium tetrabutoxide was added dropwise during con tinuous stirring of the mixture.

The dry catalyst \n powder was further stirred at room temperature for 23 hours. The catalyst composition was: Mg 0.75%, Ti 4.9%, Al \n 5.6%, Cl 17.7%. \n Example 2 \n Steps A, B and C: the procedure was the same as in example 1, except that 2.2 ml of hexamethyl disilaZane was \n used when treating the silicon dioxide.

         "4,148,754 1. \n PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OFA \n CATALYST AND CATALYST USED IN OLEFN \n POLYMERZATION \n The present invention relates to the preparation of a catalyst for the polymerization of ethylene and higher \n 1-olefins. \n A process for the preparation of a catalyst for use in the polymerization of olefins has been described, in which organic alkali metal compounds are allowed to act on the hydroxyl groups of finely dispersed metal \n oxides, for example silicon dioxide, and the reaction product is reacted subsequently with a metal halide selected from group VIIa of the Periodic system, espe cially manganese hexachloride (cf. U.S. Pat. No. 3,205,177). The solid obtained gives a catalyst suitable for use in the olefin polymerization when combined with a metallo-organic compound the metal of which is selected from one of groups I to III of the periodic system. These catalysts, however, have a low activity and produce only 1.4 kg of polyethylene per gram of manganese in 3 hours at a polymerization temperature \n of 95 C. and under an ethylene pressure of 98 atmo spheres. \n A further process comprises impregnating a solid \n carrier, for example calcium carbonate, with an alumi num-organic compound and treating it subsequently \n with an excess of titanium tetrachloride, whereby re \n duced titanium trichloride forms a sediment on the \n carrier (cf. British Pat. No. 927,969). Thereafter the excess of titanium tetrachloride must be removed. The \n polymerization activity of the catalysts thus obtained, \n however, is likewise so low that the residual catalyst must be removed from the polyolefin produced. Furthermore, there are known catalysts used in the polymerization of olefins, which are obtained by treat ing an oxide, hydroxide, carbonate or sulfate of magne sium or calcium with an aluminum-organic compound and subsequently reacting the compound obtained with \n a mixture of halides of titanium and vanadium (cf. Ger man Auslegeschrift No. 2,140,326). In the preparation of these catalysts the aluminum-organic compound and \n the transition metal compound of titanium and vana 10 \n 15 \n 20 \n 25 \n 30 \n 35 \n dium are used in an amount such that the separation of 45 an excess of these compounds may be dispensed with, but on the other hand, active catalysts for the polyolefin polymerization cannot be obtained when using as transi tion metal compounds solely titanium compounds. A catalyst, for example, which had been prepared by re acting magnesium oxide with aluminum triethyl and by subsequently treating the product obtained with tita nium tetrachloride yielded per hour only 19.5g of poly ethylene per 1 gram of titanium under an ethylene pres sure of 39 atmospheres. A secondary treatment of the polyethylene obtained was necessary for removing the \n residual catalyst because of the discoloration of poly ethylene. \n Finally a process for the preparation of supported \n catalysts has been disclosed, in which an excess of a metallo-organic magnesium or aluminum compound is \n allowed to act on silicon dioxide, aluminum oxide or a \n mixture consisting of silicon dioxide and aluminum oxide having superficial hydroxyl groups and the reac \n tion product is reacted, after the excess of said organo metallic compound has been removed by washing, with an excess of a halogen compound of a transition metal selected from one of groups IVa, Va or VIa of the 50 \n 55 \n 65 2 \n periodical system, and the excess of the transition metal compound is removed by washing with a solvent. By washing out the metallo-organic compounds of magne \n sium or aluminum and the transition metals there are formed highly diluted solutions, which must be decom posed subsequently. As a consquence thereof, undesired \n waste products are obtained, which are contained in the waste water (cf. German Offenlegungsschrift No. \n 2,109,273). It has now been found that a catalyst suitable for use in the polymerization of 1-olefins can be obtained by starting from the reaction product of silicon dioxide and/or a metal oxide with a Grignard compound as a carrier and a soluble titanium compound, which cata lyst gives high yields and allows a good control of the molecular weight by means of hydrogen without mak ing a separation of the excess of metallo-organic com pounds and/or of titanium compounds from the carrier \n necessary. The present invention consequently provides a pro cess for the preparation of a catalyst by reacting the reaction product of silicon dioxide and/or aluminum oxide and 1. a halogen-containing magnesium-organic compound and 2. a halogen compound of a transition metal (component A) with a metallo-organic compound (component B), which comprises reacting a silicon di oxide and/or aluminum oxide having a hydroxyl con tent of from 0.5 to 50 mmols/g first with a magnesium compound of the formula RMgX, in which R is a hy droxarbon radical having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms and X is chlorine, bromine or iodine, in the presence of a diluent, in an amount of from 0.05 to 1 mol of magne sium compound per mol of hydroxyl groups of the carrier and reacting thereafter the solid reaction prod uct in suspension with a halogen-containing titanium (IV) compound of the formula TiX(OR))4-, in which n is an integer of from 1 to 4, X is chlorine or bromine and R is a hydrocarbon radical having of from 1 to 12 \n carbon atoms, in an amount of from 0.01 to 1 mol of titanium compound per mol of hydroxyl groups of the carrier, to obtain the component A. Suitable carriers are porous oxides or mixed oxides of silicon and/or aluminum having a specific surface of from 50 to 1000 m2/g, preferably from 100 to 800, espe cially from 150 to 650 and a pore volume in the range of from 0.2 to 2 ml/g, preferably of from 0.4 to 2, espe cially of from 0.6 to 1.7 ml/g. The particle size is in the range of from 1 to 500 am, preferably from 10 to 200 um, especially of from 20 to 100 um. The number of hydroxyl groups depends on the specific surface and the temperature of the preliminary treatment and is in the range of from 0.5 to 50 mmols preferably of from 1 to 20 mmols, especially of from 1.5 to 10 mmols, hydroxyl groups per gram of carrier. Several of these oxides are prepared especially for being used as a carrier of sup ported catalysts. They are commercial products. Prior to the reaction of the hydroxyl groups of the carrier with the halogen-containing magnesium-organic compounds the absorbed water must be removed by drying at a temperature of from 120 to 800° C., prefera bly of from 200 to 500 C. The number of hydroxyl groups (mmol of hydroxyl groups per gram of carrier) may be modified by said treatment at high temperature, whereby it is reduced with an increasing temperature. After drying the carrier is kept under an inert gas atmosphere, for example nitrogen or argon, with the \n exclusion of air or water. "

These compounds are known as Grignard compounds and may be prepared, for example by reaction of metallic magnesium with a halogenhy drocarbon having from 1 to 20, preferably from 2 to 10 carbon atoms, for example an alkyl, -cycloalkyl-or aryl halide, in the presence of a nucleophilic solvent, for example an ether (cf. Organikum, VEB Deutscher Ver lag der Wissenschaften, Berlin, 1964, page 466). These compounds may also be prepared in a hydrocarbon in \n the absence of an ether. Preferred magnesium com pounds are ethyl magnesium chloride, n-propyl magne sium chloride, i-propyl magnesium iodide, n-butyl mag nesium chloride, t-butyl magnesium chloride, phenyl and magnesium bromide. n-Propyl magnesium chloride and n-butyl magnesium chloride are particularly prefer \n able. The Grignard compound reacts in known manner with the hydroxyl groups placed at the surface of the carrier at a temperature below 100° C. while splitting off hydrocarbon, with the addition of -Mgx to the oxygen of the hydroxyl group according to the follow ing equation: \n - - \n -o-it-oh -- RMgX -o-i-o-Mex -- R-H \n -O -O \n Consequently one mol of magnesium alkyl chloride is chemically bound per mole of hydroxyl groups of the carrier. The number of hydroxyl groups of the carrier may, consequently, be determined by volumetric or chromatographic analysis of the hydrocarbon formed or by retitration of the excess of Grignard compound. The reaction of the solid carrier with the Grignard compound may be carried out in the following way: The solid carrier is suspended in an inert diluent, the dissolved Grignard compound is added at a tempera ture of from -20° to 150° C., preferably of from 0 to 120° C., especially of from 20' to 100° C., and allowed to act on the suspension for a period of from 0.5 to 20, preferably from 0.5 to 10, especially from 0.5 to 2, hours. The proportion of Grignard compound and solid carrier is chosen such that from 0.05 to 1, preferably from 0.1 to 0.95, mol of alkyl magnesium halide is used per mole of hydroxyl groups of the carrier. The magne sium compound is applied on the carrier quantitatively in said process. The reaction is completed when no more magnesium can be detected in the supernatant \n solution after the solid carrier has settled. \n Suitable diluents are all solvents inert with regard to Grignard compounds, for example saturated hydrocar bons or ethers, for example pentane, hexane, heptane, diethyl ether, tetrahydrofurane, or mixture of both types of compounds. After completion of the above reaction the diluent is separated by filtration and drying or directly by distilla tion, at a temperature of from 50 to 200 C., if it con tains an ether. The separation of the diluent is necessary for removing the ether, which has been used for the preparation of the Grignard compound and formed a complex with said compound, owing to the fact that the ether also reacts with the titanium compound while forming a complex and deactivates the catalyst.

The solid carrier impregnated with the Grignard compound is thereafter suspended again in an inert dispersing agent, preferably in an inert hydrocarbon. A dispersing agent conventionally used for the polymeri zation under low pressure according to Ziegler is \n chosen preferably. When not an ether but a saturated hydrocarbon is used for the preparation of the Grignard compound, the \n diluent need not be separated and the titanium(IV) com pound may be directly added to the reaction mixture. Suitable inert dispersing agents are aliphatic or cycloali phatic hydrocarbons, for example pentane, hexane, heptane, cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane as well as \n aromatic hydrocarbons, for example benzene, toluene, \n xylene, and furthermore benzine or Diesel oil fractions, which have been carefully purified of oxygen, sulfur compounds and moisture, may be used. To the suspension obtained there is added subse quently a halogen-containing titanium(IV) compound, at a temperature of from 20 to 140 C., preferably of from 30 to 130 C, especially of from 40 to 120° C. and the mixture is stirred at this temperature until a titanium compound can no longer be detected in the suernatant solution, generally within a period of from 2 to 20 \n hours. The halogen-containing titanium(IV) compound is a compound of the formula TiXn (OR)4-, wherein n is an integer of from 1 to 4 and X is chlorine or bromine and R is a hydrocarbon radical, preferably an alkyl, aryl or aralkyl radical having from 1 to 12, preferably from 1 to 8 carbon atoms, especially a straight chain or branched alkyl radical having from 1 to 8 carbon atoms, for example TiCl4, TiCl3, (O-n-C3H7), TiCl2(O-n- C3H7)2, TiCl(O-n-C3H7)3, TiCl2(O-1-C3H)2, TiCl3(O-i- C3H7), TiCl3(O-CH2C6H5), TiCl2(O-CH2C6H5)2, TiCl 3(O-i-C4H9) and TiCl2(O-i-C4H9)2. Titanium tetrachloride, TiCl2(O-i-C3H)2 and TiCl 3(O-i-C3H7) are used preferably. The proportion between the titanium compound and \n the solid carrier is chosen such that of from 0.01 to 1, preferably of from 0.05 to 1, especially of from 0.1 to 1, mol of titanium compound is used per 1 mole of hy droxyl groups of the solid carrier. The proportion of, Grignard compound to the tita \n nium compound is chosen such that the atomic ratio of magnesium to titanium in the catalyst component A is in the range of from 0.01 to 10, preferably of from 0.05 to 5, especially of from 0.1 to 2. The catalyst component A thus obtained is used ei ther directly in the form of the suspension or after re \n moval of the diluent and drying.

There may be mentioned, by way of example, 1,4-butadiene, isoprene, 2-phenyl butadiene, 1,4-pen tadiene, 1,3-pentadiene and myrcene. The reaction products of Al(i-C4H9)3 or Al(i-C4H9)2H with isoprene are used preferably. They comprise, for example, com pounds of the formula \n R3 \n Z-A-R-Y-Z \n wherein Y means the groups \n R3 R4 R4 \n -Al-, - Al- crA 1-, o / N A.

The ratio between C5 and C4 radicals in the reaction prod ucts of A1(i-C4H9)3 or A1(i-C4H9)2H with isoprene may generally be in the range of from 0.25 to 10, preferably 1 to 4. A compound of this type being commercially available under the name \"aluminum isoprenyl' is used particularly preferable. Further suitable compounds for component B are chlorine-containing aluminum-organic compounds, for example dialkyl aluminum monochlorides of the for mula R52AlCl or alkyl aluminum sesqui-chlorides of the formula R53Al2Cl3, wherein R5 is a hydrocarbon radical having from 1 to 16 carbon atoms, preferably an alkyl radical having from 1 to 16, especially from 2 to 12 carbon atoms. There may be mentioned, by way of example (C2H5)2AlCl, (i-C4H9)2AlCl, (C2H5)3Al2Cl3. Especially suitable compounds for the component B are aluminum trialkyls of the formula AllR3 or alumi num dialkyl hydrides of the formula AllR2H, wherein R5 is a hydrocarbon radical having from 1 to 16 carbon atoms, preferably an alkyl radical having from 1 to 16, especially from 2 to 4 carbon atoms, for example Al(C2H5)3, Al(C2H5)2H Al(C3H7)2H, Al(i-C4H9)3, Al(i- C4H9)2H. The conversion of the titanium(IV) compound of component A into the polymerization active compound having a lower valency is advantageously performed during the polymerization by the metallo-organic com pound (component B) at a temperature of from 20' to 150° C., preferably of from 60' to 140 C. Component A may also be treated with a metallo organic compound prior to polymerizing and be used subsequently in the polymerization at a temperature of 10 \n 15 \n 20 \n 25 \n 30 \n 35 \n 45 \n 50 \n 55 \n 60 \n 65 6 \n from -30 to 150° C., preferably of from 0 to 100° C., with a molar ratio between metallo-organic compound and titanium compound of from 0.2:1 to 3:1, preferably from 0.5:1 to 2:1. If a chlorine-containing metallo organic compound is used it is advisable to wash the reaction product obtained with fresh dispersing agent. Thereafter it is activated with a further metallo-organic compound at a temperature of from 20 to 150 C. When using the catalyst according to the invention at least one 1-olefin of the formula R6-CH=CH2, wherein R6 is hydrogen or a straight chain or branched alkyl radical having from 1 to 10, preferably from 1 to 8, carbon atoms, is polymerized. Examples of such olefins are ethylene, propylene, butene-1, hexene-1, 4-methyl-pentene-1, octene-1. Ethylene is preferably \n polymerized alone or as a mixture consisting of at least 70% by weight of ethylene and at most 30% by weight \n of a further 1-olefin of the above formula. Ethylene is especially polymerized either alone or as a mixture of at least 92% by weight of ethylene and at most 8% by \n weight of a further 1-olefin of the above formula. The molecular weight of the polymer is controlled in known manner, preferably by using hydrogen. The polymerization may be carried out in solution, in suspension or in the gaseous phase, continuously or \n discontinuously, at a temperature of from 20 to 150 C., \n preferably of from 60 to 140 C., under a pressure of from 0.5 to 50 bars. It is carried out preferably under the technically interesting pressure in the range of from 1 to \n 40 bars. \n Thereby the titanium compound is used in a concen \n tration of from 0.005 to 1.5, preferably of from 0.05 to 1, mmol per liter of dispersing agent or reactor volume. The metallo-organic compound is used in a concentra \n tion of from 0.5 to 10 mmols, preferably of from 2 to 6 mmols, per liter of dispersing agent or reactor volume. Higher concentrations are also possible principally. The polymerization in suspension or solution is car \n ried out in a conventional inert solvent for low pressure processes according to Ziegler, which have been de \n scribed above. \n The process according to the invention has the ad vantage that excessive metal compounds do not have to be removed from the catalyst component A by washing, owing to the fact that both the halogen-containing mag nesium-organic compound used and the halogen-con taining titanium(IV) compound react completely with the carrier. Consequently, no washing liquids are formed from which the metal compounds must be sepa rated prior to the secondary treatment. As a conse quence thereof there are formed no metal-containing waste water or slurries. During the polymerization of ethylene and higher 1-olefins the catalyst according to the invention gives high catalyst yields under low pres \n sure, for example of from 1 to 7 bars, such that the magnesium/titanium and aluminum compound may \n completely remain in the polymer; a discoloration of the polyolefin or corrosion phenomena on the processing machines do not occur. Thus expensive operations such as a decomposition of the catalyst and a removal of the catalyst may be dispensed with. Carrying out the poly merization under a higher pressure permits use of a still smaller quantity of catalyst, as the catalyst yield is highly improved with an increasing polymerization \n pressure. The catalyst according to the invention is especially suitable for the polymerization of ethylene in the gase "

The use of oxide carriers having a particle size of more than 30 Jum, which may be obtained for example by separating fine particles by sieving, prevents finely divided catalysts or polymer \n parts from being carried out of the fluidized bed and forming deposits in exterior zones of the reactor. The catalyst according to the invention permits prep aration of a polymer, the powder in bulk of which has a high air permeability and thus may directly be used in the processing by injection molding or extrusion with out previous granulation. A good air permeability of the powder in bulk in the extruder feeding zone prevents an incorporation of air into the molten polymer, which \n would cause a formation of bubbles in the finished part. The porous silicon dioxide having one or more sur face OH groups is designated as \"silicic acid' in the examples. For determining the number of hydroxyl groups of \n the carrier 10.0 g of the dried silicic acid are reacted under an argon atmosphere while refluxing and stirring with a solution of 500 mmols of n-propyl magnesium chloride in 500 ml of diethyl ether, for a period of 4 hours. After settling of the silicic acid magnesium is retitrated in the supernatant solution by way of com plexometry. The titanium content of component A is determined colorimetrically by using hydrogen peroxide (cf. G. O. \n Muller, Praktikum der quantitativen chemischen Ana lyse, 4th edition, (1957), page 243). For the polymerization in suspension there is used a hydrated Diesel oil fraction having a boiling range of \n from 140 to 200 C. \n The melt index of the polymer is determined accord ing to DIN (German Industrial Standard) 53,735, at 190° C., by using a load of 5 kg for is and of 15 kg for i15. The reduced specific viscosity (RSV) is determined with a solution of decahydronaphthalene at 135 C. at a \n concentration of 1 g/b 1. The bulk density is determined by weighing 100 cm of polyethylene powder. The air permeability is determined in the following manner: 100 cm3 of polyethylene powder are placed in a graduated cylinder, which has an inner diameter of 3 cm and a fritted glass bottom, and air suctioned through the powder at a rate of flow of 4 l/h; the pressure de crease occuring in the powder in bulk is determined. The air permeability is then determined in the following \n nanner: \n height of the package X flow velocity air permeability (L) = diameter of the cylinder X pressure loss. \n In the present invention L is 0.023/A p - 1, whereby A p is millimeters of the water column and 1 mm water column corresponds to the pressure loss of the glass frit. The diamension of L is (cm . . sec/g). All solvents are distilled under an inert gas atmo sphere having a purity of at least 99.995% in a circula tion apparatus while passing over benzophenone potas sium and are withdrawn under an inert gas atmosphere. The preparation of the catalyst and the polymerization of ethylene are carried out under an argon atmosphere or under an atmosphere of purified nitrogen while care fully excluding air and humidity.

The solvent is withdrawn thereafter in a rotary evaporator and the solid product is dried for 2 hours at 120° C. under 0.5 torr. Thereafter the solid product is suspended in 500 ml of n-heptane under an argon atmo \n sphere, 20.3 g of titanium tetrachloride (1.0 mmol of titanium per 1 g of silicic acid) are added and the mix ture is stirred for 7 hours at 90° C. Heptane is thereafter withdrawn at 120° C. in the rotary evaporator under atmospheric pressure. 128 g of a flowable powder is \n obtained. \n The titanium analysis reveals 39.8 mg of titanium per 1 g of the component A. The atomic ratio of magnesi \n um/titanium is 1.6:1. \n 500 ml of Diesel oil are introduced into a 1 liter auto \n clave provided with a flat blade agitator, the air is dis placed by evacuating and introducing nitrogen under \n pressure three times and the autoclave is heated to 85 C. 1.14 g of aluminum triethyl and 0.12 g of the catalyst component A are added.

The yield of polyethylene was 24,000 g per 1 g of titanium or 958g per 1 g of the catalyst component A. \n EXAMPLE 2 \n Ethylene is polymerized in the presence of 0.22 g of the catalyst component A described in Example 1 under the same conditions as in Example 1, but by using in stead of aluminum triethyl 1.98 g of aluminum triisobu tyl. After 2 hours there are obtained 145g of polyethyl ene having a melt index is of 7.9 and a bulk density of 350 g/1. The RSV value is 1.84 g dl/g.

Field of the Invention \n The present invention relates to a method for poly merizing alpha-olefins, a catalyst for such a polymeriza \n tion method and a method for producing such a cata lyst. In particular, the present invention relates to a catalyst, and a method for preparation thereof, which produces linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) \n having a narrow molecular weight distribution, as evi denced by relatively low values of melt flow ratio, \n (MFR), and low hexane extractables, suitable for film and injection molding applications. The invention is also directed to a highly productive polymerization \n process carried out with the catalyst of the invention. 2. Description of the Prior Art Linear low density polyethylene polymers possess properties which distinguish them from other polyeth ylene polymers, such as homopolymers of polyethyl \n ene. Certain of these properties are described in Ander \n son et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,076,698. \n Karol et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,302,566, describe a pro cess for producing linear low density polyethylene pol \n ymers in a gas phase, fluid bed reactor. \n Graff, U.S. Pat. No. 4,173,547, Stevens et al., U.S. Pat. \n No. 3,787,384, Strobel et al, U.S. Pat. No. 4,148,754, and \n Ziegler, deceased, et al, U.S. Pat. No. 4,063,009, each describe various polymerization processes suitable for producing forms of polyethylene other than linear low density polyethylene, per se. \n Graff, U.S. Pat. No. 4,173,547, describes a supported catalyst obtained by treating a support with both an organoaluminum compound and an organomagnesium compound followed by contacting this treated support with a tetravalent titanium compound. \n Stevens et al., U.S. Pat. No. 3,787,384, and Strobel et al, U.S. Pat. No. 4,148,754, describe a catalyst prepared by first reacting a support (e.g., silica containing reac tive hydroxyl groups) with an organomagnesium com pound (e.g., a Grignard reagent) and then combining \n this reacted support with a tetravalent titanium com pound. According to the teachings of both of these patents, no unreacted organomagnesium compound is present when the reacted support is contacted with the tetravalent titanium compound. Ziegler, deceased, et al, U.S. Pat. No. 4,063,009, de scribe a catalyst which is the reaction product of an organomagnesium compound (e.g., an alkylmagnesium \n halide) with a tetravalent titanium compound. The reac tion of the organomagnesium compound with the tetra Valent titanium compound takes place in the absence of a support material. A vanadium-containing catalyst, used in conjunction with triisobutylaluminum as a co-catalyst, is disclosed \n by W.L. Carrick et al in Journal of American Chemical Society, Volume 82, page 1502 (1960) and Volume 83, page 2654 (1961). Nowlin et al, U.S. Pat. No. 4,481,301, disclose a sup ported alpah-olefin polymerization catalyst composi tion prepared by reacting a support containing OH groups with a stoichiometric excess of an organomag nesium composition, with respect to the OH groups 10 \n 15 \n 20 \n 25 \n 30 \n 35 \n 40 \n 45 \n 50 \n 55 \n 60 \n 65 2 \n content, and then reacting the product with a tetrava lent titanium compound. \n Dombro, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,378,304 and 4,458,058, disclose an olefin polymerization catalyst composition synthesized by sequentially reacting: (1) a porous Sup port with a Group IIA organometallic compound, e.g., \n a dialkylmagnesium; (2) the product of (1) with water or a hydrocarbyl alcohol, e.g., methanol; (3) the product of (2) with a transition metal compound or compounds. The product of the synthesis reaction is activated with a co-catalyst which is a Group IA, IIa, IIIA and/or IIB organometallic compound, including hydrogen. Suit able co-catalysts are n-butylithium, diethylmagnesium, trisobutylaluminum and diethylaluminum chloride. \n Best, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,558,024, 4,558,025 and 4,579,835, disclose olefin polymerization catalyst com positions prepared by reacting together a porous partic \n ulate material, an organic magnesium compound, an oxygen-containing compound, a transition metal com pound, e.g., a titanium compound (the U.S. Pat. No. \n 4,558,024) or a vanadium compound (the U.S. Pat. No. 4,579,835), and a co-catalyst. Some of the catalyst com positions of Best also include an acyl halide (e.g., see the \n U.S. Pat. No. 4,579,835 and the U.S. Pat No. 4,558,025). When the LLDPE resins are fabricated into injec tion-molded products, it is imperative to assure that such products are not susceptible to warping or shrink \n ing. As is known to those skilled in the art, the degree of warping or shrinking can be predicted from the molecu lar weight distribution of the resins. Resins having rela tively narrow molecular weight distribution produce injection-molded products exhibiting a minimum amount of warping or shrinkage. Conversely, resins having relatively broad molecular weight distribution produce injection-molded products more likely to un \n dergo warping or shrinkage. One of the measures of the \n molecular weight distribution of the resin is melt flow ratio (MFR), the ratio of high melt flow index (HLMI or I21) to melt index (I2) for a given resin. The melt flow \n ratio is believed to be an indication of the molecular \n weight distribution of the polymer, the higher the MFR \n value, the broader the molecular weight distribution. Resins having relatively low MFR values, e.g., of about 20 to 50, have relatively narrow molecular weight dis tribution. Additionally, LLDPE resins having such relatively low MFR values produce films of better strength properties than resins with high MFR values. Many catalyst systems exhibit a tendency to produce \n resins whose MFR values, although initially low, in \n crease with increased concentration of the catalyst acti vator, also known as a co-catalyst, such as various alu minum alkyls. Under certain circumstances, e.g., to improve catalyst productivity and/or comonomer in corporation, it is desirable to increase the catalyst acti vator concentration without substantially affecting the \n resin MFR. \n Another important property of LLDPE resins, man ufactured into products coming into contact with arti cles subject to FDA regulations, e.g., foodstuffs, is hex \n ane extractables which is a measure of the amount of \n low molecular weight and/or highly branched polymer fractions capable of being extracted from the manufac tured products, e.g., plastic food containers, by hexane extraction. The FDA imposed strict regulations on the amounts of allowable hexane extractables in such plastic products. \n Thus, Allen et al, European Patent Office (EPO) Application No. 87300536.1, published on Aug. 5, 1987, "

However, the productivity of the polymerization 5 process carried out with such a catalyst composition is \n lower than that of the process carried out with the same catalyst compositions activated with more commonly \n used activators, such as triethylaluminum and triso butylaluminum. Accordingly, it is important to provide a catalyst composition capable of producing a alpha-olefin poly \n mers having relatively narrow molecular weight distri \n bution (low MFR values) which remains substantially constant with varying amounts of the co-catalyst, and which catalyst composition has high activity. \n It is therefore a primary object of the present inven tion to provide a high activity catalyst for the polymeri zation of alpha-olefins yielding products of a relatively 20 \n narrow molecular weight distribution which is main tained substantially constant with varying amounts of \n the co-catalyst concentration. \n It is another object of the present invention to pro vide a high activity catalyst composition which pro- 25 \n duces alpha-olefin polymers having relatively low hex \n ane extractables. \n It is an additional object of the present invention to provide a catalytic process for polymerizing alpha-ole fins which yields linear low density polyethylene of a 30 \n relatively narrow molecular weight distribution at high productivity rates. \n SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION \n A Supported alpha-olefin polymerization catalyst \n composition of this invention is prepared in a multi-step \n process. In the first step, a mixture of a solid, porous \n carrier and a non-polar solvent is contacted with at least one organomagnesium composition of the formula O \n 15 \n 35 \n Rn Mig Rn, (I) \n where R and R are the same or different CA-C12 alkyl groups, n and n are each 0, 1 and 2, providing that m--n equals the valence of Mg. Subsequently, the mix \n ture of the first step is contacted with at least one com pound of formula (II), R2-OH, where R2 is a C1-C10 alkyl or a C1-C10 halogenated alkyl. The resulting mix \n ture is then contacted with at least one transition metal \n compound soluble in the non-polar solvent. The prod uct is dried and it is activated catalyst composition has very high productivity in the polymerization of alpha \n olefins, very effective higher comonomer (i.e., C3-C10 alpha-olefin) incorporation properties and it produces 55 polymers having relatively narrow molecular weight \n distribution and low hexane extractables. \n BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES \n FIG. 1 is a graphical representation of productivity of 60 various catalysts as a function of alcohols used in the synthesis. \n FIG. 2 is a graphical representation of melt flow ratio \n (MFR) as a function of 1-hexane content and catalyst \n activator. 65 \n FIG. 3 is a graphical representation of the depen \n dency of polymer MFR on the alcohol used in the cata lyst synthesis and catalyst activator. 45 \n 50 4. \n FIG. 4 is a graphical representation of the effect of the catalyst precursor drying temperature and catalyst \n activator on the catalyst productivity.

The polymers exhibit \n relatively low values of melt flow ratio (MFR), as com pared to similar polymers prepared in the presence of previously-known catalyst compositions, e.g., those \n disclosed by Nowlin et al, U.S. Pat. No. 4,481,301. Thus, the polymers prepared with the catalyst composi \n tions of this invention are especially suitable for the production of films and injection molding applications. Catalysts produced according to the present inven \n tion are described below in terms of the manner in \n which they are made. \n CATALYST SYNTHESIS \n The carrier materials are usually inorganic, solid, particulate porous materials which are inert to the other components of the catalyst composition and to the other active components of the reaction system. These carrier \n materials include such inorganic materials as oxides of \n silicon and/or aluminum. The carrier materials are used \n in the form of dry powders having an average particle \n size of from about 1 micron to about 250 microns, pref erably from about 10 microns to about 150 microns. The carrier materials are also porous and have a surface area of at least about 3 square meters per gram, and prefera bly at least about 50 square meters per gram. The carrier \n material should be dry, that is, free of absorbed water. Drying of the carrier material can be effected by heat ing at about 100 to about 1000 C. and preferably at \n about 600 C. When the carrier is silica, it is heated at a temperature of at least 200 C., preferably at about 200 to about 850 C., and most preferably at about 600 C. \n The carrier material must have at least some active \n hydroxyl (OH) groups to produce the catalyst composi \n tion of this invention. \n In the most preferred embodiment, the carrier is silica which, prior to the use thereof in the first catalyst syn thesis step, has been dehydrated by fluidizing with ni \n trogen and heating at about 600 C. for about 16 hours \n to achieve a surface hydroxyl concentration of about 0.7 mmols/gm. The silica of the most preferred embodi ment is a high surface area, amorphous silica (surface area=300 m2/gm; pore volume of 1.65 cm/gm), and it \n is material marketed under the tradenames of Davison \n 952 or Davison 955 by the Davison Chemical Division of W.R. Grace and Company. The silica is in the form of spherical particles, e.g., as obtained by a spray-drying \n process. \n The carrier material is slurried in a non-polar solvent and the resulting slurry is contacted with at least one organomagnesium composition having the empirical \n formula (I). The slurry of the carrier material in the solvent is prepared by introducing the carrier material "

The slurry is then contacted with the aforementioned organomagnesium composi \n tion, while the heating is continued at the aforemen tioned temperature. The organomagnesium composition has the empirical \n formula Rin Mg R\", where R and R' are the same or different C4-C12 alkyl groups, preferably C4-C10 alkyl groups, more preferably C4-C8 unsubstituted alkyl groups, and most preferably both R and R' are n-butyl groups, and m and n are each 0, 1 or 2, providing that m-n is equal to the valence of Mg. Suitable non-polar solvents are materials in which all of the reactants used herein, i.e., the organomagnesium composition, the compound of formula (II) and the transition metal compounds are at least partially soluble and which are liquid at reaction temperatures. Preferred non-polar solvents are alkanes, such as hexane, n-hep tane, octane, nonane, and decane, although a variety of other materials including cycloalkanes, such as cyclo \n hexane, aromatics, such as benzene and ethylbenzene can be employed. The most preferred non-polar solvent \n is hexane. Prior to use, the non-polar solvent should be purified, such as by percolation through silica gel and \n /or molecular sieves, to remove traces of water, oxy gen, polar compounds, and other materials capable of adversely affecting catalyst activity. \n In the most preferred embodiment of the synthesis of this catalyst it is important to add only such an amount of the organomagnesium composition that will be deposited-physically or chemically--onto the support since any excess of the organomagnesium composition \n in the solution may react with other synthesis chemi cals, and precipitate outside of the support. The carrier drying temperature affects the number of sites on the carrier available for the organomagnesium composi tion-the higher the drying temperature the lower the \n number of sites. Thus, the exact molar ratio of the or ganomagnesium composition to the hydroxyl groups \n will vary and must be determined on a case-by-case basis to assure that only so much of the ogranomag nesium composition is added to the solution as will be deposited onto the support without leaving any excess of the organomagnesium composition in the solution. \n Furthermore, it is believed that the molar amout of the organomagnesium composition deposited onto the sup port is greater than the molar content of the hydroxyl groups on the support. Thus, the molar ratios given below are intended to serve only as an approximate guideline and the exact amount of the organomag nesium composition in this embodiment must be con trolled by the functional limitation discussed above, i.e., it must not be greater than that which can be deposited onto the support. If greater than the amount is added to the solvent, the excess may react with the compound of formula (II), thereby forming a precipitate outside of the support which is detrimental in the synthesis of our catalyst and must be avoided. The amount of the or ganomagnesium composition which is not greater than that deposited onto the support can be determined in any conventional manner, e.g., by adding the or ganomagnesium composition to the slurry of the carrier in the solvent, while stirring the slurry, until the or ganomagnesium composition is detected as a solution in \n the solvent. \n For example, for the silica carrier heated at about 200 to about 850 C., the amount of the organomag O \n 15 \n 20 \n 25 \n 30 \n 35 \n 45 \n 50 \n 55 \n 60 \n 65 6 \n nesium composition added to the slurry is such that the molar ratio of Mg to the hydroxyl groups (OH) on the \n solid carrier is about 1:1 to about 6:1, preferably about 2:1 to about 4:1, more preferably about 2.5:1 to about 3.5:1 and most preferably about 3:1, depending upon the \n temperature at which the carrier material was dried. The organomagnesium composition dissolves in the \n non-polar solvent to form a solution. \n It is also possible to add such an amount of the or ganomagnesium composition which is in excess of that \n which will be deposited onto the support and then re move, e.g., by filtration and washing, any excess of the organomagnesium composition. However, this alterna \n tive is less desirable than the most preferred embodi \n ment described above. \n After the addition of the organomagnesium composi tion to the slurry is completed, the slurry is contacted \n with at least one compound of the formula (II) \n R'-OH (II) \n where R' is a C1-C10 alkyl group or a C1-C10 haloge nated alkyl group, preferably R' is a C1-C10 alkyl \n group, more preferably a C1-C4 normal alkyl group or a C1-C4 halogenated normal alkyl group, and most preferably R' is an ethyl group. Thus, the compound of \n formula (II) is preferably an alcohol and most prefera bly ethanol. The amount of the compound of formula (II) used in this synthesis step is sufficient to convert substantially all of the magnesium alkyl (Mg-R or \n MgR) groups on the carrier to magnesium alkoxy \n (MgO R') groups. In a preferred embodiment, the \n amount of the formula (II) compound added is such that substantially no excess thereof is present in the non polar solvent after substantially all of the magnesium alkyl groups are converted to the magnesium alkoxy \n groups on the carrier to prevent the reaction of the \n formula (II) compound with the transition metal com pound outside of the carrier. This synthesis step is con ducted at about 25 to about 65° C., preferably at about 30 to about 55 C., and most preferably at about 30 to \n about 40 C. \n After the addition of the formula (II) compound is completed, the slurry is contacted with at least one transition metal compound soluble in the non-polar solvent. This synthesis step is conducted at about 25 to about 65° C., preferably at about 30 to about 55 C., and most preferably at about 30 to about 40° C. In a preferred embodiment, the amount of the transition metal compound added is not greater than that which \n can be deposited onto the carrier. The exact molar ratio \n of Mg to the transition metal and of the transition metal to the hydroxyl groups of the carrier will therefore vary (depending, e.g., on the carrier drying temperature) and \n must be determined on a case-by-case basis. For exam \n ple, for the silica carrier heated at about 200 to 850 C., the amount of the transition metal compound is such that the molar ratio of the transition metal, derived from the transition metal compound, to the hydroxyl groups of the carrier is about 1 to about 2.0, preferably about 1.5 to about 2.0 and the molar ratio of Mg to the transi tion metal is about 1 to about 3, preferably about 2 to about 3. We found that these molar ratios produce a catalyst composition which produces resins having \n relatively low melt flow ratio (MFR) values of about 20 \n to about 35. As is known to those skilled in the art, such resins can be utilized to produce high strength films and "

Non-limiting examples of such com \n pounds are titanium and vanadium halides, e.g., tita nium tetrachloride, TiCl4, vanadium tetrachloride, 10 VCl4, vanadium oxytrichloride, VOCI3, titanium and \n vanadium alkoxides, wherein the alkoxide moiety has a \n branched or unbranched alkyl radical of 1 to about 20 carbon atoms, preferably 1 to about 6 carbon atoms. The preferred transition metal compounds are titanium 15 compounds, preferably tetravalent titanium com pounds. The most preferred titanium compound is tita \n nium tetrachloride. \n Mixtures of such transition metal compounds may also be used and generally no restrictions are imposed 20 on the transition metal compounds which may be in cluded. Any transition metal compound that may be used alone may also be used in conjunction with other transition metal compounds. After the addition of the transition metal compound is completed, the non-polar 25 \n solvent is slowly removed, e.g., by distillation or evapo ration. We found that the temperature at which the non-polar solvent is removed from the synthesis mix ture affects the productivity of the resulting catalyst composition. Lower solvent removal temperatures pro- 30 duce catalyst compositions which are substantially \n more active than those produced with higher solvent removal temperatures. For this reason, it is preferred to \n remove the non-polar solvent at about 40 to about 65 C., preferably at about 45 to about 55° C. and most 35 preferably at about 50° C. by drying, distillation or evaporation or any other conventional means. The resulting free-flowing powder, referred to herein as a catalyst precursor, is combined with the trimethyl \n aluminum (TMA) activator. We found that the combi- 40 nation of the precursor of this invention with the TMA activator produces an alpha-olefin polymerization cata lyst composition having very high activity, as com pared to a catalyst composition comprising the same \n catalyst precursor and other, more conventional cata- 45 lyst activators, such as triethylaluminum (TEAL). This is additionally surprising and unexpected because other \n workers in this field found that, although TMA exhibits some advantages with other catalyst precursor, it de creases the activity of such precursors, e.g., See Allen et 50 al, EPO Application No. 87300536.7, publication No. 0 231 102, published Aug. 8, 1987. The catalyst composition of this invention, activated with TMA, also exhibits extremely good higher alpha olefin (i.e., C3-C10 alpha-olefin) incorporation proper- 55 ties when it is used to polymerize ethylene with such higher alpha-olefins. The TMA activator is used in an amount which is at least effective to promote the poly merization activity of the solid catalyst component of \n this invention. The amount of the TMA activator is 60 \n sufficient to give an Al:transition metal molar ratio in the catalyst composition of about 15:1 to about 1000:1, preferably about 20:1 to about 300:1, and most prefera bly about 25:1 to about 100:1. Without wishing to be bound by any theory of opera- 65 bility, it is believed that the catalyst composition of this invention is produced by chemically impregnating the support with catalyst components sequentially added to 8 \n the slurry of the carrier in the non-polar solvent. There fore, all of the catalysts synthesis chemical ingredients \n must be soluble in the non-polar solvent used in the synthesis. The order of addition of the reagents may also be important since the catalyst synthesis procedure \n is predicated on the chemical reaction between the chemical ingredients sequentially added to the non \n polar solvent (a liquid) and the solid carrier material or a catalyst intermediate supported by such a material (a \n solid). Thus, the reaction is a solid-liquid reaction. For example, the catalyst synthesis procedure must be con \n ducted in such a manner as to avoid the reaction of two \n or more reagents in the non-polar solvent to form a reaction product insoluble in the non-polar solvent out side of the solid catalyst support. Such an insoluble reaction product would be incapable of reacting with \n the carrier or the catalyst intermediate and therefore would not be incorporated onto the solid support of the catalyst composition. \n The catalyst precursors of the present invention are \n prepared in the substantial absence of water, oxygen, and other catalyst poisons. Such catalyst poisons can be excluded during the catalyst preparation steps by any \n well known methods, e.g., by carrying out the prepara tion under an atmosphere of nitrogen, argon or other inert gas. An inert gas purge can serve the dual purpose of excluding external contaminants during the prepara tion and removing undesirable reaction by-products resulting from the preparation of catalyst precursor. \n Purification of the non-polar solvent employed in the catalyst synthesis is also helpful in this regard. \n The catalyst may be activated in situ by adding the TMA activator and catalyst separately to the polymeri \n zation medium. It is also possible to combined the cata \n lyst and the activator before the introduction thereof into the polymerization medium, e.g., for up to about 2 \n hours prior to the introduction thereof into the poly merization medium at a temperature of from about \n - 40 to about 100° C. \n POLYMERIZATION \n Alpha-olefins are polymerized with the catalysts pre \n pared according to the present invention by any suitable process. Such processes include polymerizations car \n ried out in suspension, in solution or in the gas phase. Gas phase polymerization reactions are preferred, e.g., \n those taking place in stirred bed reactors and, espe cially, fluidized bed reactors. The molecular weight of the polymer may be con trolled in a known manner, e.g., by using hydrogen. With the catalysts produced according to the present \n invention, molecular weight may be suitably controlled with hydrogen when the polymerization is carried out a relatively low temperature, e.g., from about 30 to \n about 105 C. This control of molecular weight may be evidenced by a measurable positive change in melt index (I2) of the polymer produced. \n The molecular weight distribution of the polymers prepared in the presence of the catalysts of the present \n invention, as expressed by the melt flow ratio (MFR) values, varies from about 20 to about 35, preferably about 20 to about 30, for LLDPE products having a density of about 0.900 to about 0.940, and an I2 (melt index) of about 0.5 to about 100. Conversely, HDPE products, produced with the catalysts of this invention, \n have a density of about 0.940 to about 0.965, MFR values of about 20 to about 35, preferably about 20 to \n about 30, and I2 values of about 0.5 to about 100.

The reactor was closed, and hydrogen was intro duced to raise the internal pressure to 23 psi. The con tents of the reactor was stirred at 900 rpm and the tem perature was increased to about 70° C. The reactor was filled with ethylene to a total pres sure of about 120 psi and then 0.1637 grams of Example 1 catalyst precursor, slurried in about 25 mols of hexane, was added to the reactor. The reactor temperature was adjusted to 80 C. and the reactor pressure was main tained with ethylene. The polymerization was continued for 50 minutes. 200 grams of polyethylene were obtained. The polymer \n contained 26.5 mole % 1-hexane and it had the follow \n ing properties: I2 =0.58; I21 = 16.3; I21/I2 = 28.1; den sity = 0.926 gm/cc. The productivies of the catalyst compositions were \n determined as a function of the alcohol used in the synthesis of the catalyst precursor and of the catalyst \n activators. The results are illustrated graphically in \n FIG.1. As is evident from FIG. 1, trichloroethanol produced the most active catalyst precursor, with the \n TEAL or TMA activators. However, the trichloroe thanol-based-catalyst system decayed relatively rapidly \n (half-life of about 40 minutes). The data of FIG. 1 indi cates that the TMA activator produces catalyst compo sitions having 2-3 times greater productivities than the \n TEAL activator used to activate the same catalyst pre \n CSOS. \n EXAMPLE 15 \n (Comparative Catalyst Precursor Synthesis) \n A comparative catalyst precursor was synthesized according to the teachings of Karol et al, European patent application No. 84103441.6, filed on Mar. 28, \n 1984, Publication No. 0 120 503, published on Oct. 3, 1984. This catalyst precursor is substantially equivalent \n to that of Karol et al, as disclosed in the aforementioned Published European Patent Application. It is also sub stantially equivalent to the precursors prepared by the following representative procedure. \n (a) Impregnation of Support with Precursor \n In a 12 liter flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer were placed 41.8 g (0.439 mol) of anhydrous MgCl2 and 2.5 liters of tetrahydrofuran (THF). To this mixture, \n 29.0 (0.146 mol) of TiCl30.33 AlCl3 were added drop wise over a hour period. The mixture was then heated at 60° C. for another hour in order to completely \n dissolve the material. \n Five hundred grams (500 g) of silica were dehydrated by heating at a temperature of 600 C. and slurried in 3 liters of isopentane. The slurry was stirred while 186 ml of a 20 percent by weight solution of triethylaluminum \n in hexane was added thereto over a hour period. The resulting mixture was then dried under a nitrogen purge at 60° C. over a period of about 4 hours to provide a dry, free-flowing powder containing 5.5 percent by \n weight of the aluminum alkyl. \n The treated silica was then added to the solution \n prepared as above. The resulting slurry was stirred for hour and then dried under a nitrogen purge at 60° C. over a period of about 4 hours to provide a dry, impreg nated, free-flowing powder. (b) Preparation of Partially Activated Precursor (i) The silica-impregnated precursor composition \n prepared in accordance with step (a) was slurried in 3 10 \n 5 \n 20 \n 25 \n 30 \n 35 \n 45 \n 50 \n 55 \n 60 \n 65 12 \n liters of anhydrous isopentane and stirred while a 20 percent by weight solution of diethylaluminum chloride \n in anhydrous hexane was added thereto over a hour period. The diethylaluminum chloride (DEAC) solu \n tion was employed in an amount sufficient to provide 0.36 mols of this compound per mol of tetrahydrofuran \n (THF) in the precursor. After addition of the diethylal \n uminum chloride was completed, stirring was contin ued for an additional to hour while a 20 percent by weight solution of tri-n-hexylaluminum (TNHAL) in \n anhydrous hexane was added in an amount sufficient to provide 0.25 mols of this compound per mol of tetrahy \n drofuran in the precursor. The mixture was then dried under a nitrogen purge at a temperature of 56-10 C. over a period of about 4 hours to provide a dry, free flowing powder. This material was stored under dry \n nitrogen until it was needed. \n EXAMPLE 16 \n (Preparation of LLDPE Product. With TEAL-Activated Precursor of Example 15(b)) \n The partially activated comparative catalyst precur \n sor composition of Example 15(b), with the molar ratios \n of DEAC/THF = 0.36 and TNHAL/THF=0.25, was \n used to prepare LLDPE product in a 1.6 liter autoclave \n reactor. Reaction conditions were similar to those in \n Example 9. The productivity was about 4,000 grams \n PE/gr cat/hour. \n EXAMPLE 7 \n (Preparation of LLDPE Proccuts with TMA-Activated Comparative Precursor of Example \n 15(b)) \n The partially activated comparative precursor com \n position of Example 15(b) with the molar ratios of \n DEAC/THF = 0.36 and TNHAL/THF = 0.25, was used to prepare LLDPE product in a 1.6 liter autoclave reactor. Reaction conditions were substantially equiva lent to those of Example 9, except that a TMA activator was used in place of TEAL. Catalyst productivity was \n about 4,100 gms PE/gm cat/hour. \n EXAMPLE 1.8 \n (Effect of Increasing Amounts of Cocatalyst on MFR of Polymers) \n To determine the effect of increasing the amount of TMA and TEAL cocatalyst on the MFR of the poly mers produced with the resulting catalyst compositions, the performance of a catalyst precursor substantially \n similar to that of Example 1 was compared to that of the comparative catalyst precursor of Example 15b, both \n activated with varying amounts of the TMA or TEAL cocatalysts. The polymerizations were conducted in the \n manner summarized below: \n 400 mls of dry hexane was added to a 1.6 liter auto clave at 56' C. while under a slow nitrogen purge. 200 mils (135 grams) of 1-hexane was added, followed by TEAL or TMA. Various amounts of cocatalyst were added to give the concentration ranges shown in FIGS. 5 and 6. Concentration of co-catalyst is expressed as ppm based on the total weight of hexane and 1-hexene used in the polymerization. The reactor was closed, and \n hydrogen was added from a calibrated hoke bomb, the contents were stirred at 900 rpm and the temperature was increased to 70° C. Ethylene was added to the autoclave to 120 psi and about 0.03–0.06 grams of the "

The effect of increasing amounts of the TMA or TEAL activator on the MFR of the polymers is shown graphically in FIGS. 5 and 6. \n EXAMPLES 19-20 \n Polymerizations were carried out similarly to Exam 5 \n ples 9-14, except that 450 mls of hexane and 150 mls of 10 1-hexene were used. TEAL (3 mls of a 25 wt % solution in hexane) was used as the catalyst activator. 14 \n molecule is inserted 152 times for every 1-hexene mole cule that is inserted into the polymer molecule. \n Molecular Weight Distribution (MWD) of Polymers \n The effect of catalyst composition and cocatalysts on \n the MWD of the copolymers is summarized in FIGS. 2 \n and 3. FIG. 2 shows that the MFR for the ethanol-based catalyst of Example 1 depends on both copolymer com position and cocatalyst type. For example, the MFR \n increases from about 29 to 31 (TEAL) as the 1-hexene content increases. from 2.4 mole% (density of 0.926 gms/cc) to 4.0 mole % (density of 0.914 gms/cc).

The 1-hexene response is expressed below as a reactivity ratio, r1, defined by the equation: \n where f=(CE/CH)copolymer \n F=(CE/CH)monomer \n r=kEE/kEH In the above formulae, subscripts E and H designate ethylene and hexene, respectively. Thus, lower values of r indicate improved 1-hexene incorporation proper \n ties. \n Table III summarizes the catalyst reactivity ratios \n with 1-hexene as a function of alcohol used or a transi tion metal compound on the precursor synthesis and \n activator. \n TABLE III \n Catalyst Transition \n of Metal \n Example Alcohol Compound Activator r \n ethanol TiCl4 TEAL 196 11 \n ethanol TiCl4 TMA 1529 \n 2,2,2-Trichloro \n 6A ethanol VOCL3 TEAL 39.1 - 6.1 \n 6A same VOCL3 TMA 39. 6.1 \n 6 Sale TiCl4 TEAL O1 0.8 \n 6 sale TiCl4 TMA 101 - 0.8 \n 15(b) none TiCl4 TEAL 130 (Comp.) \n 15(b) none TiCl4 TMA 130 (Comp.) \n The data of Table III indicates that the catalysts pre pared with all of the alcohols, except 2,2,2-trichlorore thanol, react relatively poorly with 1-hexene in the presence of TEAL as the activator (r1 = 196) indicating that an ethylene molecule is inserted 196 times into the polymer molecule for every 1-hexene molecule that is inserted during the polymerization reaction. In the pres ence of the TMA activator, the reactivity ratio is signifi cantly lower (r1 = 1529), indicating improved (about 22% better) 1-hexene incorporation properties with the TMA-activated catalyst precursor, i.e., an ethylene 25 \n 30 \n 35 \n 45 \n 50 \n 55 \n 60 \n 65 the same range, copolymers prepared with TMA as \n cocatalyst have MFR values from about 27 to 29. The data therefore indicates that, unexpectedly, TMA pro vides polymers with a narrower MWD as indicated by \n MFR values that are about 1-2 MFR units lower com \n pared to polymers prepared with TEAL-activated cata lysts. \n FIG. 3 shows a similar trend for other catalysts (of Examples 1, 2, 6 and 7) prepared with different alcohols with TEAL or TMA as a cocatalyst. However, the copolymer prepared with an alcohol-free catalyst pro \n vided the broadest MWD, as indicated by MFR values of about 38 to about 42. Copolymers produced with catalysts synthesized with alcohol gave MFR values ranging from about 27 to about 35, depending on alco hol type and cocatalyst. Thus, catalysts based on etha nol and TMA give copolymers with the narrowest \n MWD. Catalysts based on methanol and 2,2,2-trichloro ethanol produce copolymers with MFR values in the 32-37 range depending on density and cocatalyst. At the same density, these catalysts give products with MFR values about 2-6 units higher than copolymers prepared with the ethanol-based catalysts. \n Comparison of Titanium and Vanadium Based Catalysts of Examples 6 and 6a \n Two catalysts based on 2,2,2-trichloroethanol were prepared, one with TiCl4 (Example 6) and one with VOCl3 (Example 6A). The comparison of the effect of the transition metal on the catalyst properties is summa \n rized in Table III. \n The data in Tables II and III indicate that the catalyst \n based on titanium is about 7 times more active and in \n corporate 1-hexene about 2.5 times more slowly than \n the vanadium-based catalyst. However, the vanadium based catalyst provides a copolymer with a relatively \n broad MWD. \n Effect of Drying Temperature \n To test the effect, if any, of drying temperature on the catalyst properties, a catalyst was prepared in which the \n temperature used to remove the solvents was lowered from 90° C. (Example 1) to 55° C. Aside from the differ ent drying temperatures, the catalyst synthesis was car ried out substantially as in Example 1. The results are \n summarized in FIG. 4. "

         "; 4,374,753 1 \n POLYMERIZATION CATALYST AND METHOD \n BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION \n In this invention, the polymerization catalysts useful in polymerizing and copolymerizing 1-olefins are pre \n pared by the reaction of silica or alumina with a func tional silane compound, organomagnesium compound, \n an alcohol, and a titanium, vanadium, zirconium or mixture of these compounds. These catalysts are then activated, associating them with an organoaluminum cocatalyst. These catalyst products are primarily useful for the polymerization of 1-olefins such as ethylene and the copolymerization of these 1-olefins. One of the features of the invention is to provide an improved method of polymerizing with these catalysts in the particle form slurry, gas phase or solution form polymerization processes. \n Another feature of the invention is that the polymeri zation reactions promoted by the improved catalysts are more readily modified by hydrogen so that desirable high melt index polymers are easily made. A further feature is that the higher melt index poly mers so produced are narrow in molecular weight dis tribution and are therefore highly suitable for injection molding or cast film applications. \n Yet another feature of the invention is to provide a catalyst yielding high melt index, high density polyeth \n ylene in the particle form process without reactor foul \n 1ng. \n Still another feature of this invention is the produc tion of ethylene-1-alkene copolymers, commonly \n known as linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), by the catalyst of this invention. These copolymers can have densities from 0.915 to 0.960 g/cm3 and properties suitable for film and injection molding applications, for example. \n K. Ziegler first discovered two component catalysts based on compounds of the Group IVB-VIIB metals of the periodic table and an organometallic compound belonging to Groups I-IIIA of the periodic table for the polymerization of olefins. Since his discovery, numer ous catalysts have been disclosed as improvements over the original Ziegler catalysts. Most of these catalyst systems are of relatively low activity and stability. They require a costly catalyst removal step. \n One of the modifications attempted in an effort to increase the activity of the Ziegler type catalyst was to deposit the catalyst components on an inert support. In \n U.S. Pat. No. 2,981,725, such a process is disclosed. The supports used were magnesium chloride, silicon car bide, silica gel, calcium chloride, etc. The activity of the catalysts disclosed in these patents \n was still low. \n South Africa Applm. No. 69/3534, 10/5/69 by Van Den Berg and Tomiers of Stamicarbon describes cata lysts made from organomagnesium compounds, alkyl \n aluminum chloride compounds, and titanium com pounds which are increased in reactivity by the addition of alcohols. A support, or granular ingredient, is not \n used, there is no separation of the solvent, and the use of a cocatalyst is not disclosed. German Offen. No. 2,721,058, 11/23/78, by Gunter Schweier et al. of BASF reveals a catalyst with a po rous inorganic oxide like silica or silica-alumina as a support. A solution of a reaction mixture of an alcohol, a titanium trihalide, and : a magnesium compound is \n added to the oxide, and then the solvent (i.e. the alco 2 \n hol) is evaporated giving an intermediate solid product. \n 5 \n O \n 15 \n 20 \n 25 \n 30 \n 35 \n 40 \n 45 \n 50 \n 55 \n 60 \n 65 This solid product is suspended in a solution of an or ganometallic compound, which may be an alkyl alumi \n num or silicon halide compound. The suspended solid component may be used as is along with an organome tallic compound as a cocatalyst. The suspended solid \n compound can also be filtered, and washed prior to use, and for gas phase polymerization it can be coated with wax. The magnesium compounds are not alkyl magne \n sium compounds but alkoxides and halides and other types of compounds. \n Another Schweier patent, German Offen. No. 2,721,094 is similar to this one. It reveals that the silica or silica-alumina may be treated with an alkyl aluminum halide compound beforehand. \n U.S. Pat. No. 4,110,523, 8/29/78, also by Schweier et al., covers a similar catalyst. In this case, the treatment with the alkyl aluminum or silicon halide solution is \n eliminated. \n U.S. Pat. No. 4,130,699, 12/19/78 by G. R. Hoff and Peter Fotis of Standard Oil Company discloses sup ported catalysts for vapor phase polymerization which \n are made less active prior to feeding to the reaction vessel by treatment with alcohols, acetates, ketones, aldehydes, or esters. \n U.S. Pat. No. 4,105,585, 8/8/78 by Ian Matheson of BP Chemicals describes catalysts prepared from the reaction of magnesium powder, a titanium halide and \n alcohol. \n U.S. Pat. No. 3,647,772 by N. Kashiwa (Mitsuit Pet rochemical, 5/7/72) involves treating anhydrous mag nesium carbonate with polar organic compounds in \n cluding alcohols. When this is done, more titanium from titanium tetrachloride can be fixed upon the magnesium carbonate. Catalyst reactivity, melt index and bulk den sity of the product are increased by the treatment with the polar organic compound. \n None of the above patents disclose the method and products of this invention. \n SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION \n The catalysts of this invention are formed from four \n reactive materials. One of the reactive materials is the \n product formed by the interaction of an oxide like silica or alumina with an organic silicon compound. This \n silane-treated silica or alumina is combined with an \n organomagnesium compound, an alcohol, and a tita nium or vanadium compound. From the resulting reac tion mixture, a solid, free-flowing catalyst is separated. The catalyst so formed is activated by an organoalumi num compound. \n This invention provides novel catalysts, methods of making them and methods of polymerizing and copoly merizing 1-olefins. These catalysts are especially useful for the polymerization of ethylene to high density poly ethylene, and for the copolymerization of ethylene with \n 1-olefins for the formation of medium and low density copolymers. These improved catalysts are highly active \n and are well suited for the economical and energy effi cient particle form and gas phase processes. Specifically, the object of this invention is to improve the well known Ziegler type catalyst by the method of this invention. These improved catalysts can be easily adapted to the particle form or gas phase process plants. \n Polymers made using the invention catalysts can have \n high MI and narrow molecular weight distribution. Thus, polymers well suited for injection molding and "

The catalysts of this invention are stable, particulate, \n and easy flowing. . . . . - \n The alcohol modification allows the production of higher melt index polymers in response to the addition of hydrogen to the polymerization reaction. The silane treatment, in comparison with catalysts prepared with \n out the silane treatment of the silica or alumina, leads to polymers of more narrow molecular weight distribu tions. The catalysts of this invention surprisingly retain both of these good features and are thus superior for the production of high melt index injection molding resins by ethylene polymerization. A totally unexpected advantage of the invention cata lysts is that they can produce ethylene-1-olefin copoly \n mers (so-called LLDPE, linear low density polyethyl ene), with melt elasticity properties suitable for the manufacture of high strength blown film. The catalysts of this invention yield polymers with high melt index values at relatively low hydrogen con centration in the polymerization reaction. Thus, less hydrogen is required to obtain a given desired high melt index. This affords a savings on hydrogen and gives a higher reactivity because higher concentrations of hy drogen decrease the polymerization rate. The catalysts \n of this invention give a relatively narrow molecular weight distribution at a given melt index. A narrow molecular weight distribution is desirable in polymers used for injection molding and in cast film applications because better strength is obtained. In the copolymerization of 1-olefins and ethylene to form low density copolymers of lower melt index, the catalysts of this invention can produce products with superior melt elasticity which is associated with high strength blown film. The catalysts of this invention are made from a com bination of silica or alumina, certain organic silicon compounds, an organomagnesium compound, an alco \n hol, and a titanium compound. The catalysts are acti vated by an organoaluminum compound. \n The silica or alumina materials may contain minor amounts of zirconia, magnesia, or titania. For catalyst manufacture, it is preferred to have relatively finely \n divided silica or alumina, which may be porous or non \n porous. The organic silicon compound must have at least one functional group which can react with the surface hy droxyl groups of the silica or alumina, and by means of this reaction the organic silicon residue must be bonded to the surface of the silica or alumina or mixtures of \n these. Prior to the reaction between the organic silicon compound and the silica or alumina, the silica or alu mina may be dried to completely remove the water at a temperature less than about 800 C. The drying may be \n only partial so as to leave a small amount of water to catalyze the reaction of the organic silicon compound with the surface groups. Usually, it is preferred to at least partially remove the surface water from the silica \n or alumina. The amount of organic silicon compound may be in excess of the reactive surface groups. In this case, the conversion of the surface groups can be made as com plete as possible, and the unreacted excess can be re moved by distillation at less than 200° C., at pressures less than one atmosphere if necessary, or by heating combined with purging with an inert gas. The reaction product of the silica or alumina with the organic silicon compound should not be heated above 300 C., since 5 \n 10 \n 15. \n 20 \n 25 \n 30 \n 35 \n 45 \n 50 \n 55 4. \n decomposition of the bonded silane groups may occur. The amount of organic silicon compound may be less than the stoichiometric equivalent of the surface reac tive groups. In this case, no removal of excess is neces \n sary. \n The alcohols that are suitable for this invention con tain only one alcoholic hydroxyl group per molecule, and only carbon and hydrogen atoms in addition to the one oxygen atom. Phenols or alcohols with the hy droxyl directly bonded to an aromatic ring are not suit \n able. \n The alcohol can be added to the silane-treated silica or alumina immediately prior to the addition of the organomagnesium compound. The alcohol can also be added after the organomagnesium compound. It must, however, be combined into the catalyst mixture before the titanium compound. The reaction of the alcohol with the catalyst ingredi ents can be conducted at temperatures between 15° C. to about 100° C. but about room temperatures is com pletely satisfactory. \n The amount of alcohol is chosen to give an alcohol to magnesium ratio between 0.1 to 5. Ratios higher than 2 * give less reactive catalysts and are not normally desired. Ratios less than 0.5 normally do not result in a sufficient increase in hydrogen response. A ratio of about 1.0 is preferred. \n The amount of titanium compound is normally less than the amount equivalent to the reactive surface groups. However, the amount of titanium compound can vary from 5% to 200% of that equivalent amount. Trialkylaluminum compounds such as triethylalumi num and triisobutylaluminum are excellent cocatalysts. Alkyl aluminum hydrides like diisobutyl aluminum hy dride can be used. Mixtures of organoaluminum com pounds are suitable. An example is a combination of triisobutylaluminum and diethyl aluminum ethoxide. \n The amount of cocatalyst is not critical. The molar ratio of organoaluminum cocatalyst to titanium com pound in the solid, free-flowing catalyst can range from 0.1/1 to 100/1. Preferably, the ratio is from 1/1 to 10/1. Activation of the catalyst with the cocatalyst can be accomplished within the polymerization reactor by the simultaneous feeding of both components. Alterna tively, the cocatalyst can be added to the catalyst prior to entry into the polymerization zone. \n DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED \n EMBODIMENTS \n The catalysts of this invention have higher melt index capability and reactivity than normal Ziegler catalysts. These catalysts are simple to prepare and in the pre \n ferred method, are highly economical because of the lack of necessity of calcination, solvent washing, high temperature reaction, grinding, etc. In this invention, the silicon compound has one or more reactive groups for each silicon atom in the mole cule. One of these reactive groups may be consumed by a surface reaction. Then the attached silicon atom may have no reactive group or it could have some reactive groups. The remaining reactive groups can interact with the magnesium component of the catalyst. By such interaction, the polymerization reactions can be influ enced toward desirable properties in the polymer prod \n ucts. The silicon compounds useful in this invention have the following structural formulae: "

The unreacted excess of silicon compound can be removed by distillation at less than 200 C. at decreased pressure if necessary, or by heat and inert gas purging. The reaction product of the silica or alumina with the silane should not be heated above 300 C., which might lead to thermal decomposition of the bonded silane groups. The amount of silane compound may also be less than the stoichiometric equivalent of the reactive groups upon the silica or alumina.

Normally, the Mg/Tiratio is from 0.1 to 5, most preferably 1.0. The addition of alcohol to the catalyst preparation is before the tetravalent titanium compound but can be before or after the addition of magnesium alkyl.

The alkyl groups of suitable cocatalysts have hydrocarbon chains con \n 40 taining one or about ten carbon atoms and may be straight chained or branched. Triaryl aluminum com pounds may also be used but because they are not so readily obtained as the alkyl compounds, they are not preferred. Examples of suitable cocatalysts are triethyl \n aluminum, trioctyl aluminum, tri(2-methyl pentyl )aluminum and diethyl aluminum hydride. Trisobutyl aluminum and diisobutylaluminum hydride are espe cially preferred. If needed, alkyl aluminum halides may be used along with the alkyl aluminum compounds \n described above. \n The cocatalyst may be fed to the polymerization \n reactor along with the above-described solid compo nent in the same or preferably separate lines. The molar is ratio of the cocatalyst to the Group IVB and VB metal compounds in the solid component can be from 0.1:1 to 100:1 although the preferred range is 1:1 to 20:1.

The tests showed that the invention catalyst gave a much higher melt \n index: \n Reactivity Meit \n g/g cat/hr Index \n Invention \n Catalyst 3310 39 Comparison \n Catalyst 3442 9.2 \n EXAMPLE 3 \n Another test of the catalyst of Example 2 was done in the 2 l pressure vessel but with only 50 psi hydrogen \n added instead of 100 psi. This test gave an hourly catalyst reactivity of 5052 \n with the product having a melt index of 2.4 and an RD value of 3.6. Previously, a comparison catalyst had been \n made in a similar way but without silane-treated silica. in place of the silane-treated Davison 952 silica, ther mally treated silica was used. The temperature of treat ment was 600 C. This comparison catalyst gave an hourly reactivity of 224.5, a melt index of 3.0, and an RD \n value of 4.5. The RD value is a measure of molecular \n weight distribution and was measured as described in the article in Polymer Engineering and Science, Vol. II, pages 124-128 (1971). The lower RD value of the poly mer produced by the invention catalyst shows the prod uct to be more suitable for injection molding applica \n tions. \n EXAMPLE 4 \n The two catalysts of Example 2 were tested for ethy lene-butene copolymerization in a 1400 ml pressure vessel. In each case a sample of the catalyst, a volume of 25 wt.% triisobutyl aluminum solution and 500 ml of isobutane were introduced into the polymerization wes sel. The amount of trisobutyl aluminum solution was chosen to give 9.2 mmol/g of solid catalyst. The tem perature of polymerization was 160' F. After the isobu tane addition, hydrogen was added to give a 50 psi increase in pressure. Ethylene and 1-butene were then metered in over a period of five to seven minutes. Eth ylene was added as required to give a total pressure of \n 350 psig while the amount of 1-butene added was ap proximately 22 wt.% of the reaction vessel contents. \n The reactions were continued for one hour after the 350 \n psig total pressure was attained. During this hour an additional 15 g quantity ofbutene was added to replace the portion polymerized. \n The results of the tests showed that the invention catalyst gave a low density copolymer with superior melt elasticity. The invention catalyst also gave a higher melt index and reactivity: \n Reactivity Meit \n g/g cat/hr Index \n Invention \n Catalyst 9090 st Comparison "

A 1.8g quantity of hexamethyldisila \n Zane-treated silica was combined in a nitrogen atmo sphere with 20 ml of heptane and 5.7 ml of abutyl octyl magnesium solution in heptane. The quantity of butyl octyl magnesium was 2.25 mmoles. The combination was stirred one half hour at room temperature, then 0.21 ml of n-butyl alcohol was added. This mixture was stirred for one half hour. A 0.25 ml volume of titanium tetrachloride was added as small drops from a syringe to form the catalyst slurry. The slurry was kept at room temperature for another thirty minutes, then the flask \n was immersed in an oil bath at 100 C. The flask was \n kept in the bath for 30 minutes at the end of which time the solvents had evaporated leaving a free-flowing \n solid. \n Another catalyst was made with the butyl octyl mag nesium solution in the same way except that the n-butyl alcohol was omitted. \n The two catalysts were tested under identical condi tions as described in Example 2, in a 21 polymerization vessel with 100 psi hydrogen at 215 F.

A catalyst was prepared with the addition of n-butyl alcohol in the same way as the catalyst of Example 5 except that a dibutyl magnesium solution was added instead of the butyl octyl magnesium solu tion. The dibutyl magnesium solution was obtained from the Lithium Corporation of America. In this prod uct, a portion of butyl groups are secondary butyl groups and the remainder are normal butyl groups. A polymerization test was conducted as in Example 5 giving polyethylene with a melt index of 49 and a reac tivity of 1463 g/g cat. hr. \n EXAMPLE 7 \n In this example, the molar ratio of the alcohol to the magnesium compound was varied. Three catalysts were made with the addition of n-butyl alcohol as described in Example 5 but with different amounts of alcohol. Also, in this case, butyl ethyl magnesium was used as the magnesium compound. The amount of butyl ethyl magnesium solution for each of the three catalysts was 1.25 mmoles per gram of the hexamethyldisilazane \n treated silica. The amount of titanium tetrachloride was \n also 1.25 mmoles per gram in each case.

The procedure for preparation was the same as in Example 5, and butyl ethyl magnesium was the magnesium compound. A 2.1 \n g quantity of the silane-treated silica was transferred to the dry, N2-purged flask. A 20 ml volume of heptane and 1.91 ml of the butyl ethyl magnesium solution were combined with the silica. With reaction periods as in Example 5, 0.11 ml n-butyl alcohol and 0.29 ml of tita nium tetrachloride were added. The solvent was evapo rated by heating at 100° C. for 50 minutes. In the poly merization test at 215 F. with 100 psi H2, polyethylene with a melt index of 36 was produced. The reactivity of the catalyst was 2471 g/g cat. hr. TIBAL solution at 9.2 mmoles per gram of catalyst was again employed as the cocatalyst. \n EXAMPLE 9 \n This example shows that the magnesium to titanium atomic ratio can be greater than 1.0 in the invention catalyst. The procedure and ingredients were the same as in Example 8 but the Mg/Tiatomic ratio was 1.5, the butyl ethyl magnesium to n-butyl alcohol molar ratio \n was 1.0, and the titanium tetrachloride was 1.25 mmoles per gram of silane-treated silica. The catalyst was tested for the synthesis of a 1 butene-ethylene copolymer as described in Example 4. \n The reactivity was found to be 4364 g/g cat. hr. The melt index of the product was 2.9 and its density was 0.927. \n The catalyst was also tested in the particle form syn thesis of polyethylene as described in Example 2. The melt index of the homopolymer was 57, and the reactiv ity of the catalyst under the given conditions was 1917 g/g cat. hr. \n EXAMPLE 10 \n A catalyst was prepared as in Example 1 except that benzyl alcohol was added to the preparation instead of butyl alcohol.

The process for obtaining the catalyst of the present inven \n tion comprises the steps of \n 0002 (a) impregnating an activated silica In particles using a solution of an organometallic compound of the \n groups 1, 2, 12 or 13 of the periodic table, in an inert organic solvent; \n 0003) (b) removing the supernatant liquid from the step \n (a): \n 0004 (c) preparing a solution obtained by reacting at least one magnesium compound, selected from mag \n nesium halides and magnesium alkoxides and at least \n one titanium compound selected from titanium alkox ides and titanium halogen alkoxides; \n 0005 (d) impregnating the silica obtained on (b) using \n the solution prepared in (c); \n 0006 (e) optionally reacting the solid obtained In (d) with a reducing agent; \n 0007 (f) reacting the solid obtained in (d) or (e) with a halogenating agent; \n 0008 (g) treating thermally the solid obtained in (f); \n 0009 (h) washing the solid obtained in (g) with an inert organic solvent; \n 0010 (i) optionally, washing the solid obtained in (h) \n with a solution of one or more organometallic com pounds of the groups 1, 2, 12 or 13 of the periodic table. \n 0011. The catalyst component obtained is especially suit able for the production of homo- and copolymers of ethylene \n as narrow molecular weight distribution high density poly ethylene and linear low density polyethylene with controlled morphology and improved properties. \n BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION \n 1) Polymerization Process \n 0012. The slurry or gas phase processes for the produc \n tion of HDPE or LLDPE operating with low bulk density \n polymer need reactors with large Volumes in order to obtain the necessary residence time. Particularly, in the gas phase \n reactors the presence of fines with low bulk density causes \n troubles. In fact, due to the friction of the polymer particles present into the reactor the fines are especially prone to the \n formation of electrostatic charges and tend to deposit and adhere to the metallic walls. These stagnant deposits does \n not allow the exchange of the reaction heat and become hot spots, which can form layer of agglomerates containing \n eventually melt polymer. After some time chunks of agglomerates can fall down and plug the product discharge \n system. The described effects are enhanced when the reac tion is carried out with a highly active catalyst. Jul. 27, 2006 \n 0013. In the U.S. Pat. No. 5,410,002 a summary of patents on the above described phenomena is presented. \n 0014. Therefore, it is crucial for the process that the catalyst used enables a total control of the polymer mor phology resulting in product grains without fines, with high bulk density and good flowing properties. \n 0015. Another very important aspect is that the catalyst \n must have a slow decaying time to permit the use of reactors \n in series. This arrangement makes possible the obtainment \n of bimodal products in addition the reduction of the total \n volume of reaction for the same production basis. Moreover, process operation with a different condition of reaction in at \n least two reactors in series, turns possible the use of catalysts with higher particle size thereby minimizing the formation \n of electrostatic charges. \n 2) Polymer Structure \n 0016. The catalyst properties are fundamental to the polymer structure, mainly in respect of the molecular weight \n distribution, comonomer insertion in the polymeric chain \n and soluble content. \n 0017. Each application used to achieve a final product \n from high density polyethylene (HDPE) or linear low den sity polyethylene (LLDPE) requires a specific polymeric \n Structure. \n 0018 To obtain a film with improved optical and mechanical properties and avoid blocking problems, a poly \n mer having narrow molecular weight distribution (MFR-27), is required. A large quantity of LLDPE appli cations requires products with density=0.918 and MI=0.7. \n and in most cases a xylene soluble content<10% is desired. Indeed, when the xylene soluble content of the polymer is \n present in a high concentration (>10%) and with a low \n molecular weight, this soluble tends to migrate to the film Surface causing blocking, in addition to the unsatisfactory \n optical properties (low gloss and high haze). \n 3) Ziegler-Natta polyethylene catalyst \n 0019. Due to the strong competition existent in the poly ethylene market, the catalyst production cost is a fundamen \n tal component. Therefore it is mandatory that the catalyst for producing polyethylene be manufactured by a simple route, \n from low cost raw material, without generating gaseous, \n liquid or solid effluents hard to treat. \n 0020. The patent U.S. Pat. No. 5,188,997 describes a synthesis process for Ziegler-Natta catalysts from silica and \n magnesium chloride alcoholate. The results reported dem \n onstrate that this catalyst produces a polymer with low bulk \n density (0.23 to 0.30 g/ml) and with an intermediate molecu \n lar weight distribution (MFR 30.0 to 37.8). \n 0021. The patent U.S. Pat. No. 5,585.317 describes the synthesis of a catalyst Supported on a magnesium chloride \n based carrier. The reported examples relates to the produc tion of polymers having good morphology, characterized by \n the absence of fines and by the high bulk density which is for \n LLDPE produced between 0.32 and 0.40 g/ml and for HDPE \n between 0.33 and 0.438 g/ml. \n 0022. However, in the case of LLDPE production, the \n polymer obtained presents an undesired comonomer distri \n bution in its chain, evidenced by the high xylene soluble \n content at different polymer densities.

The mass ratio co catalyst: catalyst in the polymerization process is between \n 0.5:1 and 6.0:1. \n 0089 An important feature is its ability to produce, when \n Submitted to polymerization conditions, particles of homo and copolymers of ethylene with controlled morphology \n having high bulk density and containing a very small \n quantity of fines. This feature allows the use of this catalyst in a process where the catalyst can be fed directly into the \n polymerization reactor.

This feature helps to prevent the forma \n tion of polymer sheets or agglomerates on the reactor walls. The good catalytic yield and the low decay kinetics observed \n for the present invention, allows its use in most polymer ization processes, including processes operating in more \n than one reactor in series. \n 0091. A further feature characteristic of the catalyst of the present invention is when using a microspheroidal silica as \n Support the catalyst obtained has also a spheroidal morphol ogy and in consequence a polymer product with good \n morphology and flowability is obtained. \n 0092. The catalyst component of the present invention is advantageously used in the polymerization of ethylene and \n mixtures thereof with alpha-olefins CH=CHR, wherein R is an alkyl or cycloalkyl or aryl radical with 1-12 carbon \n atoms because it has a high activity and low decay kinetics.

Polymerization processes of this type are known; their special feature compared with other similar pro cesses is the special embodiment of the catalyst system, and the processes disclosed in European Laid-Open application Nos. 17,895 and 144,021, European Pat. No. \n 45,977, Australian Pat. No. 543,049 and British Pat. No. 2,143,834 may be mentioned as prototypes for the pres \n ent case. \n The special embodiments of the catalyst systems are produced in order to achieve certain aims, such as the following: \n The catalyst system should be easy to prepare and give an increased yield of polymer having a very large \n isotactic fraction. In addition, particularly because of the thermodynamics of the procedure, easy molecular weight regulation, in particular with hydrogen, is of great importance. \n The catalyst system should moreover produce poly mers having special morphological properties, for ex \n ample uniform particle size and/or smaller fractions of very fine particles and/or a high bulk density. In addi tion to these parameters which are important for con trolling the polymerization systems, working up the \n polymers and/or processing the latter, a low halogen content in the polymer is of importance, particularly with regard to corrosion problems; this can be achieved by increasing the polymer yield and/or by means of a catalyst system which contains very little halogen. \n Some of these aims can be achieved by the prior art only by means of very expensive processes, as is the 2 \n case, for example, with the process according to U.S. \n Pat. No. 4,399,054, or when other aims are neglected. For example, British Pat. No. 2,049,709 discloses a process in which a magnesium halide, a titanium halide and an electron donor are applied to a metal oxide car rier. However, the polymer obtained has a compara \n 10 \n 15 \n 20 \n 25 \n 30 \n 35 \n 45 \n 50 \n 55 \n 60 \n 65 tively low isotacticity. \n European Laid-Open application Nos. 14,523 and \n 171,200 and British Pat. Nos. 2,101,609 and 2,101,611 describe catalyst systems whose titanium component is \n obtained by treating a solid, inorganic oxide with an organic magnesium compound, a Lewis base and tita \n nium tetrachloride, it being necessary in addition to use a halogenating agent which is not titanium tetrachloride and/or an organic compound of the metals boron, alu \n minum, silicon or tin or a boron trihalide or a halogen containing alcohol. Despite an expensive and tedious preparation procedure, the productivity of the corre sponding catalyst system is unsatisfactory. \n U.S. Pat. No. 4,467,044 discloses a catalyst system which contains, as a titanium component, a silica car rier, a magnesium halide and/or manganese halide, a \n titanium halide and an electron donor. In order to ob tain catalyst systems having relatively high productiv \n ity, additional treatment with an organometallic com pound of a metal of groups I to III of the periodic table is indispensable here. However, the productivity and stereospecificity of the catalysts prepared in this manner \n are, in absolute terms, low. The known processes are thus unsatisfactory, in par ticular with regard to high isotacticity and good mor phology coupled with good productivity. It is an object of the present invention to provide a titanium component which, compared with the prior art processes, has high productivity and is at the same time capable of giving polymers having high isotacticity and good morphology. \n We have found that this object is achieved by a cata lyst system which contains a titanium component (1) prepared in three stages in a particular manner from (I) magnesium chloride, (II) a certain alkanol, (III) a cer tain carrier comprising finely divided inorganic oxide carrier material which has been pretreated with an al kylchlorosilane, (IV) titanium tetrachloride and (V) a specially selected phthalic acid derivative. The present invention accordingly relates to a pro cess for the preparation of homopolymers of propene and copolymers of propene with minor amounts of other C2-C12-a-monoolefins, in particular C2-C6-a- monoolefins, by polymerization, in particular dry-phase polymerization, of the monomer or monomers at from 20 to 160 C., in particular from 50 to 120° C., under from 1 to 100, in particular from 20 to 70, bar using a Ziegler-Natta catalyst consisting of \n (1) a titanium component which contains titanium, magnesium, chlorine and a benzenecarboxylic acid de \n rivative on a carrier, (2) an aluminum component of the formula \n AR3, \n where R is alkyl of not more than 8, in particular not \n more than 4, carbon atoms, \n and \n (3) a silane component of the formula "
