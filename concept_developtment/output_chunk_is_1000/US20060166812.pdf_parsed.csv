 SOLID CATALYST COMPONENT FOR 
 POLYMERIZATION AND COPOLYMERIZATION 
 OF ETHYLENE, AND, PROCESS FOR OBTAINING 
 THE SAME 
 0001. The present invention relates to a solid catalyst component for ethylene polymerization and copolymeriza 
 tion, composed of a carrier of particulate silica and a catalytically active portion including titanium, magnesium, 
 chlorine, alkoxy groups and at least one organometallic 
 compound of the groups 1, 2, 12 or 13 of the periodic table. The process for obtaining the catalyst of the present inven 
 tion comprises the steps of 
 0002 (a) impregnating an activated silica In particles using a solution of an organometallic compound of the 
 groups 1, 2, 12 or 13 of the periodic table, in an inert organic solvent; 
 0003) (b) removing the supernatant liquid from the step 
 (a): 
 0004 (c) preparing a solution obtained by reacting at least one magnesium compound, selected from mag 
 nesium halides and magnesium alkoxides and at least 
 one titanium compound selected from titanium alkox ides and titanium halogen alkoxides; 
 0005 (d) impregnating the silica obtained on (b) using 
 the solution prepared in (c); 
 0006 (e) optionally reacting the solid obtained In (d) with a reducing agent; 
 0007 (f) reacting the solid obtained in (d) or (e) with a halogenating agent; 
 0008 (g) treating thermally the solid obtained in (f); 
 0009 (h) washing the solid obtained in (g) with an inert organic solvent; 
 0010 (i) optionally, washing the solid obtained in (h) 
 with a solution of one or more organometallic com pounds of the groups 1, 2, 12 or 13 of the periodic table. 
 0011. The catalyst component obtained is especially suit able for the production of homo- and copolymers of ethylene 
 as narrow molecular weight distribution high density poly ethylene and linear low density polyethylene with controlled morphology and improved properties. 
 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 
 1) Polymerization Process 
 0012. The slurry or gas phase processes for the produc 
 tion of HDPE or LLDPE operating with low bulk density 
 polymer need reactors with large Volumes in order to obtain the necessary residence time. Particularly, in the gas phase 
 reactors the presence of fines with low bulk density causes 
 troubles. In fact, due to the friction of the polymer particles present into the reactor the fines are especially prone to the 
 formation of electrostatic charges and tend to deposit and adhere to the metallic walls. These stagnant deposits does 
 not allow the exchange of the reaction heat and become hot spots, which can form layer of agglomerates containing 
 eventually melt polymer. After some time chunks of agglomerates can fall down and plug the product discharge 
 system. The described effects are enhanced when the reac tion is carried out with a highly active catalyst. Jul. 27, 2006 
 0013. In the U.S. Pat. No. 5,410,002 a summary of patents on the above described phenomena is presented. 
 0014. Therefore, it is crucial for the process that the catalyst used enables a total control of the polymer mor phology resulting in product grains without fines, with high bulk density and good flowing properties. 
 0015. Another very important aspect is that the catalyst 
 must have a slow decaying time to permit the use of reactors 
 in series. This arrangement makes possible the obtainment 
 of bimodal products in addition the reduction of the total 
 volume of reaction for the same production basis. Moreover, process operation with a different condition of reaction in at 
 least two reactors in series, turns possible the use of catalysts with higher particle size thereby minimizing the formation 
 of electrostatic charges. 
 2) Polymer Structure 
 0016. The catalyst properties are fundamental to the polymer structure, mainly in respect of the molecular weight 
 distribution, comonomer insertion in the polymeric chain 
 and soluble content. 
 0017. Each application used to achieve a final product 
 from high density polyethylene (HDPE) or linear low den sity polyethylene (LLDPE) requires a specific polymeric 
 Structure. 
 0018 To obtain a film with improved optical and mechanical properties and avoid blocking problems, a poly 
 mer having narrow molecular weight distribution (MFR-27), is required. A large quantity of LLDPE appli cations requires products with density=0.918 and MI=0.7. 
 and in most cases a xylene soluble content<10% is desired. Indeed, when the xylene soluble content of the polymer is 
 present in a high concentration (>10%) and with a low 
 molecular weight, this soluble tends to migrate to the film Surface causing blocking, in addition to the unsatisfactory 
 optical properties (low gloss and high haze). 
 3) Ziegler-Natta polyethylene catalyst 
 0019. Due to the strong competition existent in the poly ethylene market, the catalyst production cost is a fundamen 
 tal component. Therefore it is mandatory that the catalyst for producing polyethylene be manufactured by a simple route, 
 from low cost raw material, without generating gaseous, 
 liquid or solid effluents hard to treat. 
 0020. The patent U.S. Pat. No. 5,188,997 describes a synthesis process for Ziegler-Natta catalysts from silica and 
 magnesium chloride alcoholate. The results reported dem 
 onstrate that this catalyst produces a polymer with low bulk 
 density (0.23 to 0.30 g/ml) and with an intermediate molecu 
 lar weight distribution (MFR 30.0 to 37.8). 
 0021. The patent U.S. Pat. No. 5,585.317 describes the synthesis of a catalyst Supported on a magnesium chloride 
 based carrier. The reported examples relates to the produc tion of polymers having good morphology, characterized by 
 the absence of fines and by the high bulk density which is for 
 LLDPE produced between 0.32 and 0.40 g/ml and for HDPE 
 between 0.33 and 0.438 g/ml. 
 0022. However, in the case of LLDPE production, the 
 polymer obtained presents an undesired comonomer distri 
 bution in its chain, evidenced by the high xylene soluble 
 content at different polymer densities. As an example, a "
4,US20060166812.pdf,/home/anatoly_kayda/Desktop/mipt/data/braskem/US/US20060166812.pdf,5,NO,"US 2006/0166812 A1 
 polyethylene with 0.919 g/ml of polymer density has a 
 xylene soluble content of 12.5% by weight. 
 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 
 0023 The present invention relates to a solid catalyst component for ethylene polymerization and copolymeriza 
 tion, composed of a carrier of particulate silica and a catalytically active portion Including titanium, magnesium, 
 chlorine, alkoxy groups and at least one organometallic 
 compound of the groups 1, 2, 12 or 13 of the periodic table. 
 The process for obtaining the catalyst of the present Inven tion comprises the steps of 
 0024 (a) impregnating an activated silica in particles using a solution of an organometallic compound of the 
 groups 1, 2, 12 or 13 of the periodic table, in an inert organic solvent; 
 0025 (b) removing the supernatant liquid from the step 
 (a): 
 0026 (c) preparing a solution obtained by reacting at least one magnesium compound, selected from mag 
 nesium halides and magnesium alkoxides and at least 
 one titanium compound selected from titanium alkox 
 ides and titanium halogen alkoxides; 
 0027 (d) impregnating the silica obtained on (b) using 
 the solution prepared in (c); 
 0028 (e) optionally reacting the solid obtained in (d) with a reducing agent; 
 0029 (f) reacting the solid obtained in (d) or (e) with a halogenating agent; 
 0030 (g) treating thermally the solid obtained in (f); 
 0031 (h) washing the solid obtained in (g) with an inert organic solvent; 
 0032 (I) optionally, washing the solid obtained in (h) 
 with a solution of one or more metal-alkyl halide compounds of the groups 1, 2, 12 or 13 of the periodic 
 table. 
 0033. Therefore, the present Invention provides a catalyst especially suitable for the production of ethylene homo- and 
 copolymers as narrow molecular weight distribution high density polyethylene (NMWHDPE) and linear low density 
 polyethylene (LLDPE) with controlled morphology and improved properties. 
 0034 Additionally, the catalyst described and claimed in 
 the present invention produces a NMWHDPE with a melt 
 flow ratio (MFR) lower than 27 that are particularly suitable for thermoforming and injection applications. 
 0035) Further, the catalyst described and claimed in the present invention produces a LLDPE with a low xylene 
 soluble content due to the very good comonomer insertion allowing the production of films with Superior optical prop 
 erties and very low blocking. 
 0036) The present invention provides still a catalyst that 
 provides, when Submitted to polymerization conditions, particles of ethylene homo and copolymers having high bulk 
 density and containing a very Small quantity of fines. Jul. 27, 2006 
 0037. The present invention provides additionally a cata lyst useful in liquid phase or in gas phase, ethylene poly 
 merization process. 
 0038. The present invention provides further a catalyst useful in polymerization process due to its high activity and 
 low decay kinetics.

 by Volume of solution of organometallic compound of the groups 1, 2, 12 or 13, in aliphatic hydrocarbons, and 
 maintained under stirring at a temperature which ranges 
 from room temperature to the boiling point of the solution of organometallic compound of the groups 1, 2, 12 or 13, in aliphatic hydrocarbons, preferably at room temperature, 
 over a period from 30 to 120 minutes, preferably between 50 
 and 60 minutes. 
 0.055 The organometallic compounds of groups 1, 2, 12

 0064. In general, when preparing the solution of the step 
 (c), titanium is used in Such an amount that the molar ratio Ti/Mg varies within the range of 0.3 to 4, and preferably 
 within the range of 0.5 to 2. 
 0065. In step (d) the silica obtained on step (b) is sus pended in an inert organic solvent, Such as a hydrocarbon 
 solvent of the aliphatic type, preferably the same used in the previous steps and the dissolved product prepared on Step (c) 
 is added to the Suspension. The impregnation is carried out by Suspending 100 parts by weight of silica, obtained on step 
 (b), for each 5 to 200 parts by volume of the component 
 prepared on Step (c) and after dilution in the inert organic 
 Solvent. The Suspension is maintained under stirring at a temperature that ranges from room temperature to the boil

 of time from 30 to 180 minutes, preferably between 50 and 60 minutes. In this way a solid component Suspended in an 
 inert organic solvent is obtained. 
 0066. Optionally the solid component obtained in step (d) 
 can be submitted to reducing conditions in a step (e). Said result is obtained, for example, by using reducing agents, Such as Na-alkyls, Li-alkyls, Zn-alkyls, Mg-alkyls and cor responding aryl-derivatives, Grignard compounds of the 
 type RMgX, wherein R represents a linear or branched alkyl group, containing from 1 to 10 carbons or aryl-derivatives

 atoms, aryl with 6 to 10 carbon atoms, alkoxyl with 1 to 10 
 carbon atoms, aryloxyl with 6 to 10 carbon atoms or carboxyl wit 1 to 10 carbon atoms, and n is a degree of polymerization that ranges between 5 and 100. Specific examples of such polymethylhydrosiloxanes (PMHS)

 or aryl-silanes (RSiH, in which R is alkyl or aryl and X is a number varying from 1 to 3) and alkoxy-silanes or aryloxy-silanes (ROSiRI, in which R is alkyl or aryland 
 X is a number varying from 1 to 3). 
 0068 The reducing agent chosen from the above examples, preferably polymethylhydrosiloxanes (PMHS), is 
 added to the solid obtained in the step (d), dissolved pref erably in the same inert organic solvent used for the reaction Suspension. This addition is carried out slowly over a period 
 of time from 30 to 180 minutes, preferably between 50 and 
 80 minutes and the Solid Suspension is maintained under stirring at a temperature ranging from room temperature to 
 the boiling point of the aliphatic hydrocarbon used as 
 solvent, preferably at 60° C. 
 0069. The amount of reducing agent that can be used in step (e) corresponds to the amount ranging from 0 to 2 moles 
 per mole of titanium, preferably between 0 and 0.1 mole per 
 mole of titanium. It has been observed, in the experiments, Jul. 27, 2006 
 that the quantity used of this reducing agent can control the 
 amount of titanium fixed on silica at the final catalyst. 
 0070. In the next step of the process according to the 
 present invention, the Suspension obtained in (d) or (e), 
 which is still under stirring, is put in contact and interacted with one or more halogenating agents.

 preferably from 1.5 hours to 2.5 hours. The temperature of the Solid Suspension halogenation ranges from room tem perature to the boiling point of the aliphatic hydrocarbon 
 used as solvent, preferably at 60° C. 
 0075 According to the present invention, in step (g) of 
 the process, the solid obtained in (f) is kept under higher temperature that depends on the inert organic solvent used. 
 0076. The time necessary for this thermal treatment of the 
 solid obtained in step (f) ranges from 0.5 hour to 5 hours, preferably from 3 to 5 hours. The ideal temperature for this 
 purpose depends on the organic solvent used and it can be 
 conducted from 60° C. to 120° C., preferably from 60° C. to 
 75° C., when hexane is used as the organic solvent. 
 0077. At the step (h) after the thermal treatment, the solid can be separated from the Suspension, for example by 
 settling and siphoning, filtration or centrifugation, washed 
 with an inert organic solvent, preferably hexane, and then dried. The washing temperature can vary from room tem perature to the boiling point of the aliphatic hydrocarbon 
 used as solvent, preferably at room temperature. 
 0078. Optionally, the solid obtained in (h) is washed with a solution of organometallic compounds of the groups 1, 2, 
 12 or 13. More specifically, in the optional step (i) the solid 
 obtained in step (h) is suspended in an inert organic solvent 
 Such as hexane or heptane, and it is put in contact with one "

 or more organometallic compounds of the groups 1, 2, 12 or 13 of the periodic table, preferably metal-alkyl compounds 
 or metal-alkyl halide compounds belonging to these groups, 
 in special aluminum, magnesium, lithium and Zinc com pounds. Specific examples of these compounds are methy 
 laluminum dichloride, methylaluminum sesquichloride, isobutylaluminum dichloride, isobutylaluminum ses 
 quichloride, ethylaluminum dichloride (EADC), diethylalu 
 minum chloride (DEAC), ethylaluminum sesquichloride (EASC), tri-n-hexylaluminum (Tn-HAL), tri-n-octylalumi 
 num (TnOAL). They can be used concentrated or preferably 
 dissolved in the above organic solvent or in a different organic solvent chosen from aliphatic hydrocarbons. The 
 process is carried out at a temperature ranging from room 
 temperature to the boiling point of the organic solvent used 
 as solvent, preferably at room temperature, for a period of 
 time that can vary from 10 minutes to 24 hours, preferably 
 from 40 minutes to 5 hours. 
 0079 When using more than one organometallic com pound in the step (i), the different compounds can be fed in 
 the same solution or in individual Solutions, at the same time or in Subsequent additions. 
 0080. The amount of the metal-alkyl halide compound of the groups 1, 2, 12 or 13 or metal-alkyl compound of the 
 groups 1, 2, 12 or 13, used in the step (i) of the process 
 corresponds to the amount ranging from 0 to 3 g of the corresponding metal-alkyl halide compound of the groups 1, 
 2, 12 or 13 or metal-alkyl compound of the groups 1, 2, 12 or 13, per g of dry catalyst component obtained, preferably 
 between 0.05 and 1 g of the corresponding metal-alkyl 
 halide compound of the groups 1, 2, 12 or 13 or metal-alkyl compound of the groups 1, 2, 12 or 13, per g of dry catalyst 
 component obtained. 
 0081. The use of inert organic solvents, most specifically aliphatic hydrocarbons, in all process steps of the present 
 invention brings another important feature to the Solid catalyst component characteristics. The Solid catalyst com 
 ponent obtained is completely free of residual polar sol 
 vents, such as ethanol, and their derivatives in its final composition. 
 0082 The titanium amount that remains fixed on the solid catalyst component may reach up to 10% by weight, 
 expressed as the Ti metal content, and it is preferably 
 comprised between 0.5 and 2% by weight. 
 0083. The magnesium amount that remains fixed on the Solid catalyst component may reach up to 6% by weight, 
 expressed as the Mg metal content, and it is preferably 
 comprised between 0.3 and 3.0% by weight. 
 0084. The chlorine amount that remains fixed on the solid catalyst component may reach up to 20% by weight, 
 expressed as the C1 contents, and it is preferably between 5 and 12% by weight. 
 0085. The alkoxy amount that remains fixed on the solid catalyst component may reach up to 20% by weight and it 
 is preferably between 3 and 8% by weight. 
 0.086 The amount of organometallic compound of the 
 groups 1, 2, 12 or 13 that remains fixed on the Solid catalyst component may reach up to 5% by weight, expressed as the 
 metal contents, and it is preferably between 0.3 and 3% by weight. This organometallic compound of the groups 1, 2, Jul. 27, 2006 
 12 or 13 are metal-alkyl compounds or metal-alkyl halide compounds belonging to these groups, in special organoalu 
 minum, organomagnesium, organolithium and organozinc 
 compounds, pure or in mixtures. 
 0087. The particle size distribution of the solid catalyst component of the present invention is very close to the silica used as carrier and, as consequence, its average particle size 
 ranges also from 10 to 120 um. The solid catalyst component surface area ranges from 80 to 300 m/g and its pore volume ranges from 0.1 to 1.0 ml/g. 
 0088. The catalyst component of the present invention is Suitable for using in liquid phase or gas phase, ethylene polymerization process. The co-catalyst used in the poly 
 merization process is an alkyl-aluminum, preferably trim 
 ethyl aluminum or triethyl aluminum. The mass ratio co catalyst: catalyst in the polymerization process is between 
 0.5:1 and 6.0:1. 
 0089 An important feature is its ability to produce, when 
 Submitted to polymerization conditions, particles of homo and copolymers of ethylene with controlled morphology 
 having high bulk density and containing a very small 
 quantity of fines. This feature allows the use of this catalyst in a process where the catalyst can be fed directly into the 
 polymerization reactor. Particular forms to feed the catalyst are in dry bulk powder, in paste, in oil suspension or in 
 Solvent Suspension. As an alternative the catalyst can be prepolymerized with ethylene or propylene and optionally 
 with a comonomer before being fed into the reactor. 
 0090 Another important feature of the present invention 
 is its tolerance to the high electrostatic charges occurring in gas phase reactors. This feature helps to prevent the forma 
 tion of polymer sheets or agglomerates on the reactor walls. The good catalytic yield and the low decay kinetics observed 
 for the present invention, allows its use in most polymer ization processes, including processes operating in more 
 than one reactor in series. 
 0091. A further feature characteristic of the catalyst of the present invention is when using a microspheroidal silica as 
 Support the catalyst obtained has also a spheroidal morphol ogy and in consequence a polymer product with good 
 morphology and flowability is obtained. 
 0092. The catalyst component of the present invention is advantageously used in the polymerization of ethylene and 
 mixtures thereof with alpha-olefins CH=CHR, wherein R is an alkyl or cycloalkyl or aryl radical with 1-12 carbon 
 atoms because it has a high activity and low decay kinetics. In particular, it is used in the preparation of 
 0093. High density polyethylenes (HDPE, having a den sity greater than 0.940 g/cm), particularly with narrow 
 molecular weight distribution (MFR-27), including homopolymers of ethylene and copolymers of ethylene with 
 one or more alpha-olefins having from 3 to 14 carbon atoms. These products are particularly suitable for thermoforming and injection applications; 
 0094) Linear medium density and linear low density polyethylenes (LMDPE and LLDPE, having a density lower than 0.940 g/cm) most specifically very low and ultra low 
 density linear polyethylenes (VLDPE and ULDPE, having a density lower than 0.920 g/cm and as low as 0.880 g/m) consisting of copolymers of ethylene with one or more "

 alpha-olefins having from 3 to 14 carbon atoms, having a 
 content of units derived from ethylene greater than approxi mately 80% by weight. These products have improved 
 properties due to the very good comonomer insertion and, in 
 most cases, they have also a narrow molecular weight 
 distribution (MFR-27). Hence the low xylene soluble con tents are obtained, allowing the production of films with Superior optical properties and very low blocking. The 
 LMDPE products are particularly useful for rotomolding applications; 
 0.095 Elastomeric copolymers of ethylene and propylene 
 and elastomeric terpolymers of ethylene and propylene with 
 minor amounts of a diene, having a content of units derived from ethylene comprised between about 30 and 70% by weight.
